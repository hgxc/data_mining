AWB SAYS AUSTRALIAN WHEAT SALES OVER 10 MLN TONNES
The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB)1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnesalready sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said.    "We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne exporttarget for the year," he said in a statement.    He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWBspokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, theSoviet Union and Iraq.
    In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWBexported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.    Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest hasended after a long, cool summer with 15.
14 mln tonnes deliveredto the AWB.    The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct ofreceivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said.    However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain wasstill being held on farms and further milling and feed wheatmay be delivered following the recent announcement of the finalGuaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said.
    Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's FebruaryWheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes.    But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate couldturn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and thefinal crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.
2 mln tonnes.The official estimate is not yet available.    In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.
08 mln tonnes ofthe 16.13 mln tonne crop.    Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allowfarmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB'sreceival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economicsdata.

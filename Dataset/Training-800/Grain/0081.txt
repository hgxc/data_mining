HOUSE 0/92 PLAN SEEN SCALED-BACK TO 1987 WHEAT
Key members of the House Agriculturecommittee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of apending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but abroader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later,Congressional sources said.    The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. GlennEnglish (D-Okla.
), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to supportan amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm(D-Tex.
) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 cropwinter and spring wheat.    This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the originalproposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987wheat only. That provision was later broadened by thesubcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.
    Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but stillcollect 92 pct of deficiency payments.    Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponeduntil next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid billand 0/92.    The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot programfollows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influentialfarm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.
    Congressional sources said there has not been enough timeto study the implications of a broad 0/92.    "The timing (of the proposal) is off," said one aide to aHouse Agriculture committee member.    However, several Congressional sources said they expect abroader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the HouseAgriculture committee is faced next month with the need to makespending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as partof an overall deficit reduction package.
    Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley(D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts mayexceed one billion dlrs.    A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both theCongressional Budget Office and the Reagan administrationestimate it would result in significant budget savings.
    A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5billion dlrs over five years.    Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is theapproach of planting season, Congressional sources said.
    Some officials said it already is late for implementationof a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 forwheat and feedgrains.    If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up eitherwould have to be extended or reopened, sources said. Reuter

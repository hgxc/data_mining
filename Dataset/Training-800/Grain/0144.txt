U.S. MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE-BOSCHWITZ
A marketing loan for U.S. wheat,feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplusproduction situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. RudyBoschwitz (R-Minn.) said.
    "I think I would not support a marketing loan now," he toldthe House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans andfeedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of amarketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focusedsupport on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.    A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage moreproduction, especially in high-yielding areas, would be muchmore expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loansand not increase exports significantly, he said.

CANADA CORN DECISION UNJUSTIFIED - YEUTTER
U.S. trade representative ClaytonYeutter said Canada's finding announced today that U.S. cornimports injure Canadian farmers is "totally unjustified."    "U.S. corn exports to Canada are so small that it isinconceivable that they injure Canadian corn farmers by anyreasonable measure," Yeutter said in a statement.    He said if other countries follow Canada's lead it couldresult in "a rash of protectionist actions throughout theworld.
" French corn growers have recently indicated they willchallenge U.S. corn gluten feed shipments to Europe.    Yeutter said the U.S. will examine the Canadian decisionclosely and if the U.S. believes the decision was not based onfacts, "will carefully evaluate appropriate responses." Yeutterdid not say what steps the U.S. may take in response.

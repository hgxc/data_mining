SOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA
Despite earlier optimisticindications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stagein its development and recent reports of heat stress couldreduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, thedepartment said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87(Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pctfrom the previous year.
    The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows aperiod of severe droughts, which at one point required SouthAfrica to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, itsaid.    Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facingincreased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.
    But if South Africa is perceived as lacking availablesupplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, thedepartment said. Reuter

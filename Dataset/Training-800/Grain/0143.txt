CARGILL OFFICIAL DEFENDS CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS
The use of generic in-kind commoditycertificates has helped ease storage problems and is anecessary part of export promotion programs, a senior executivefor the world's largest grain company said.    Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee onwheat, soybeans and feedgrains, Robbin Johnson, vice presidentof Cargill, Inc., disputed claims that U.S. grain companieshave made huge profits from certificate trading.
    "The certs program is not in any way a windfall to thetrade," he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealingwith a two pct spread in certificate transactions, and thatthis is within the normal grain marketing levels.    Johnson recognized current concern over the cost ofcertificates as compared to cash, but said that critics need tolook more closely at the savings caused by certs, noting forexample that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Rollmarketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs.
    Certificates are also an important part of any exportpromotion program, he said.    "The more you look at ways to expand export markets, themore you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more graininto the market to meet demand," he said.    Subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman (D-Kans.
) said hiscommittee would be looking at the certificate program laterthis year and studying the General Accounting Office report oncertificate costs. Reuter

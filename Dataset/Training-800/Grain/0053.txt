AMERICAN FARM BUREAU OPPOSES FARM BILL CHANGES
The directors of the American FarmBureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesdayto urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place withoutalterations.    "We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,"said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has beenin place for just a little over a year and in our judgmentthere is more to be gained at the present time from maintainingthe legislation.
    "Several independent studies ...
 indicate the 1985 farmbill is better on balance than any of the alternatives beingadvanced," Kleckner said.    The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much ashe deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeanscompetitive in the world market.    A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should beeligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIKcertificates for the difference between 5.
02 dlrs a bushel andthe new loan rate.    The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiencypayments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheatbecause of adverse weather. Reuter

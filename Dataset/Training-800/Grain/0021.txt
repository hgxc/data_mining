USSR WHEAT BONUS RUMORS PERSIST DESPITE DENIALS
Grain trade representatives continuedto speculate that the Reagan administration will offersubsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. AgricultureDepartment officials said there was no substance to thereports.    "It's pure fiction," said one senior official at USDA'sForeign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that theadministration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscowin the next two to three weeks.    An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked notto be identified said there was nothing to substantiate thespeculation, which he said was started by "somebody fanning the(wheat) market.
" Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on thebasis of the speculation.    One lobbyist with close connections to the Reaganadministration said a Soviet trade team told private graintrade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy asmuch as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it beforemid-year, if it was "competitively priced."    Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet tradingorganization, told Reuters he had no information tosubstantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, butsaid that Moscow "would consider" buying U.S. wheat if it wascompetitively priced.
    "We don't care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) arelooking for is competitive prices," Ivlev said. "If they (theadministration) are interested in selling it (wheat), theyshould find ways to do it." Reuter

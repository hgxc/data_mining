U.S. CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT/CORN SUPPLIES
From April through December 1986,the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrsworth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had notbeen exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment said.
    The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs incertificates has been authorized for issuance duringJanuary-August, 1987.    These certificates will provide ample free supplies of cornand wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the departmentsaid in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.
    Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grainmore competitive on world markets, it said.    The department said last summer, for example, certificateswere exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helpedincrease marketable supplies, so farm-level corn pricesaveraged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than theywould have otherwise.
    The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40to 50 mln bushels, it said.    The department said government spending on farm programs infiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.
    During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first halfof the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force,annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from lastyear's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.    The department said the President's budget proposals for1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24billion dlrs.
    In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remainclose to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pctaverage of 1980-86, it said.
    Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volumeis expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in sevenyears, the department said. Reuter

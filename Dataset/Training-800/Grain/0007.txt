USDA SAID UNLIKELY TO BROADEN CORN BONUS OFFER
The U.S. Agriculture Departmentprobably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment tocorn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in theconservation reserve program last year, an aide to USDASecretary Richard Lyng said.    Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng hadindicated he would consider giving those farmers the same twodlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987program this month.
    But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that thedepartment would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers whoenrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year.    "How are you going to stop the tide," he said, referring todemands that would follow from other commodity groups. Reuter

EC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA
The European Community, EC, sold75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuingbid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs pertonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latestreport on Export Markets for U.S grains.    EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes inthe 1985/86 season, it said.
    The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at atime when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheatimport market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the currentforecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.
    The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline indomestic production, and says government plans to lower theguaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrswill contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.    It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier ofthe additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase ofU.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

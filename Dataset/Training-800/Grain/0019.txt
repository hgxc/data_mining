U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION
All major grain producing countriesmust do their part to help reduce global surpluses and therecent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S.wheat organizations said.    The recent Australian proposals were a good starting pointfor discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feelthey are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on worldgrain trade, the president of the National Association of WheatGrowers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates saidin a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.    Future discussions on international wheat trade shouldinclude three topics -- a commitment to privatization ofgovernment-run export trading entities, a commitment to publicdisclosure of sales and other terms if government entities areinvolved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, thetwo organizations said     While the Australian proposals are welcome the twoorganizations said they are not in total agreement with theirassessments.
    Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. targetprices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue toplace the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.farmers, they said.      Other countries, including Australia, have benefittedfrom the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S.acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.    "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- andsubsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stockinggrain and changing programs which protect our growers," JimMiller, president of NAWG said.
    "We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among theworld's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks andrestore profitability to agriculture," Miller said. Reuter

LYNG DISAPPOINTED BY CANADA CORN INJURY DECISION
U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he is "very disappointed" by a Canadian governmentfinding that U.S. corn has injured Ontario Corn growers.    "This action is not helpful in the context of the ongoingU.S.-Canada free trade talks or in the new round ofmultilateral trade negotiations," Lyng said in a statement.    The Canadian government today said Ottawa would continue toapply a duty of 84.
9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports.    Lyng said the U.S. made a case that U.S. corn imports arenot the cause of any problem of Canadian corn producers, addingthat U.S. corn exports to Canada are declining.    "Apparently they (Canada) have ignored the fact thatCanadian corn and other coarse grain production is risingfaster than consumption," Lyng said.

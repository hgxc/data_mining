Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee,Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, andshould also include the Soviet Union.    Rep.
 Roberts said there had been some talk that the issueof an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reaganadministration recently because Secretary of State GeorgeShultz was out of the country.    "That very well may be the case," said Tom Kay, U.S.Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Serviceadministrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his replyto Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge.
    Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of theUSDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow.    "I'd be delighted to deliver the message," Kay replied.
    Earlier, Kay had repeated Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng's statement last week that "the door is not yet closed onan eep to the Soviet Union." Reuter

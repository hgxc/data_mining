U.S. SENATOR TO PROPOSE 0/92 FOR 1987 CROPS
Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said heintended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producersof wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much theyplanted.
    Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee thatapplying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops wassupported by the Reagan administration and would saveapproximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in cornpayments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.    The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on theSenate floor or in a conference committee with the House ofRepresentatives in the event a similar bill before the HouseAgriculture Committee is approved by that body.    Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S.Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiencypayments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose notto plant under the decoupling scheme.
    If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, marketprices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminisheddeficiency payments.    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon aspossible on the issue, but would have to study the matterfurther before deciding how he would vote on it.

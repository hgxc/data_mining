U.S. HOUSE TARGETING PROPOSAL SPARKS INTEREST
A proposal by two U.S. HouseDemocrats to target government farm benefits to small- andmedium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on aHouse subcommittee today.    "On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen," saidRep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.
), Chairman of the House AgricultureSubcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. "This is thefirst hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternativeto the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal."    The plan, offered by Reps.
 Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and ByronDorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrsper bushel and for corn to 3.
50 dlrs. Producers could receivedeficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but notmore than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.    The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons notactively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.
    Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over fiveyears, protect family farms and eliminate governmentaccumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would behalted.    However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.
) said the measure would"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who afamily farmer is."    Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict programpayments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.    Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the billwould determine if a person was actively engaged in farming andtherefore eligible for payments.

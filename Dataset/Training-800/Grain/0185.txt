WORLD CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA
Dry weather covered most Europeancrop areas in the week ended March 14, except for those insouthwestern France, southern Italy, and Greece, the JointAgricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture andCommerce Departments said.    In its International Weather and Crop sumary, the agencysaid mixed rain and snow covered Greece.    Winter grains in England, France, and northern Italyremained dormant.
 Grains usuaually break dormancy in March.    Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy inearly April, it said.    Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areasof northern Pakistan and northern India, it said.
    Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in centralIndia and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas bylate April.    Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India,reversing February's below-normal trend.    Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in mostsouthern areas, it said.
    In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to thecentral islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzonand southern Mindanao.    Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia asrainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands.    In February locally heavy showers may have caused floodingin Java, it said.
    The second cnsecutive week of dry weather stressed Moroccanwinter grains, approaching teh heading stage, the agency said.    Light to moderate rain spread from northern Thailand toNorthern Vietnam as dry weather prevailed elsewhere inSoutheast Asia.    Dry weather covered winter grain areas in western andcentral Algeria, but soil moisture was likely adequate to meetcrop demands, it said.
    Light showers in eastern Algeria and Tunisia maintainedadequate moisture for crop growth, it said.    Timely rains will be needed in the next several weeks aswinter grains advance through the critical reproductive phase,the agency said. Reuter

FRENCH EXPORTERS SEE HIGHER WHEAT SALES TO CHINA
French exporters estimated that around600,000 tonnes of French soft wheat has been sold to China fordelivery in the 1986/87 (July/June) year.    Around 300,000 tonnes were exported to China between July1986 and February this year.    Another 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes will be shipped duringthis month and around the same amount in April, they said.
    France sold around 250,000 tonnes of soft wheat to China in1985/86, according to customs figures.

French maize producers will ask the ECCommission to grant permanent maize export rebates followingthe recent EC/U.S. Accord guaranteeing the U.S. An annualexport quota of two mln tonnes of maize for Spain over fouryears, the French maize producers association, AGPM, said.    The Commission has already decided to accord rebates forthe export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize, of which rebatesfor around 100,000 tonnes have been granted.    The request will be made when export certificates have beengranted for all the 500,000 tonnes, the AGPM said.
    The association said that the request would cover exportsto all destinations, adding that the Soviet Union, which hasimportant maize needs, is currently excluded from the list ofdestination countries for the 500,000 tonnes of French maize.    The U.S. Agriculture Department has forecast Soviet maizeimports for the 1986/87 campaign at 4.90 mln tonnes against10.

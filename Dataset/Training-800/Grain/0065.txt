WESTERN CANADA HURT BY INTERNATIONAL FORCES
Western Canada's resource-based economyis being hurt by international market forces and there islittle Ottawa can do about it, Finance Minister Michael Wilsonsaid.    "If you can tell me how we can get the international energyprice up and how we can get the price for copper up and how wecan get the price for wheat up, then we will listen," Wilsontold the House of Comnons Finance Committee.    Although under pressure from oil companies and wheatfarmers for help in battling depressed commodity prices, Wilsonsaid it has to be recognized the area was a "prisoner of marketforces outside the boundaries of this country.
"    Wilson, appearing before the committee to discuss thegovernment's spending estimates released earlier this week,said the government is doing what it can in the region, citingmore than 3.5 billion dlrs in aid for western agriculture.    "Those resources are a reflection of very real concerns onour part in dealing with a very difficult problem," Wilson saidin response to questions about management of the economy fromopposition party members.
    He said the long term answer for depressed regions of thecountry was reaching a free trade pact with the United States,which he claimed would improve the outlook for Western Canada. Reuter

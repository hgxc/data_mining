USDA OFFICIAL SEES 7-8 BILLION DLRS CERTIFICATES
There will be seven to eight billiondlrs of generic certificates on the market by the end ofharvest, an Agriculture Department official said.    The Commodity Credit Corp will "depend heavily" oncertificates to relieve storage problems this year, RalphKlopfenstein, Deputy Administrator for Commodity Operations,USDA, told participants at the National Grain and FeedAssociation's annual convention.    Klopfenstein said that CCC will not be able to relocategrain in any significant amount this fall, so certificates willbe used in various programs to relieve storage tightness.
    Klopfenstein said certificates meet the goal of allowingprices to go below loan levels and providing USDA with aninventory management tool. Reuter

U.S. COULD COMPLAIN TO GATT ON CANADA CORN DUTY
U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter suggested the U.S. could file a formal complaint withthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) challengingCanada's decision to impose duties on U.S. corn imports.    Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply aduty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn shipments, Yeuttersaid the U.S. could file a formal complaint with GATT under thedispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code.
    Other U.S. options would be to appeal the decision inCanadian courts, or to retaliate against Canadian goods, alower-level U.S. trade official said. However, retaliation isan unlikely step, at least initially, that official said. Nodecision on U.S. action is expected at least until afterdocuments on the ruling are received here later this week.

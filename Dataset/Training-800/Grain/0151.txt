U.S. CONSERVATION SIGNUP SEEN 10 TO 12 MLN ACRES
Grain traders and analysts look for a10 to 12 mln acre sign-up in the USDA's conservation reserveprogram, scheduled to be announced after 1400 CST today.    The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of theacres submitted, they said.    Total enrollment in the first three years of the program isonly 8.
9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this yearhas underpinned new crop corn futures all week.    However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up mayend up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing tradetalk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submittedby farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservationprogram are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on totalcorn production will be minimal, they added.

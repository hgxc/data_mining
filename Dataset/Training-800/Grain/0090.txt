U.S. FEEDGRAINS GROUP ATTACKS CANADA CORN RULING
The U.S. Feedgrains Council issurprised and disappointed by the Canadian Import Tribunal'sdecision that imports of corn from the U.S. are materiallyinjuring Canadian corn producers, a council spokesman said.    "At a time when the world is attempting to liberalize tradein the new rounnd of multilateral negotiations, it isincomprehensible that a country that stands to gain so muchfrom the reduction in agricultural trade barriers wouldthreaten that process by caving in to pressures forprotectionism," council president Darwin E. Stolte said.    Canada's finding will strain the U.S./Canadian tradingrelationship, could damage the future of U.S. feedgrains support for the free trade negotiations, and also negativelyimpact farm trade reform with other nations, the council said.

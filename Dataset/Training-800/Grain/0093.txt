U.S. CORN GROWERS BLAST CANADA CORN RULING
Canada's ruling in favor of a duty onU.S. corn was a keen disappointment to the National CornGrowers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for othernations to follow, said Mike Hall, lobbyist for theassociation.    "The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now andjust change corn to corn gluten feed" in their complaint, Halltold Reuters.    A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farmpolicies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers andsupported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85cts per bushel.
    "This was cleary a political decision," Hall said. "Theamount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant."    The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrumentthat Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices andthat American farm policy has driven down these prices, thuscausing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger governmentpayments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.
    Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but thatother nations might also now apply this same argument to attackU.S. farm programs.    The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farmprograms create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hallsaid. The French have long wanted to control the imports ofU.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that theimported feed was unfairly displacing European grain.

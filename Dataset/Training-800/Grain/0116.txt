MARKET DISCOUNTS HIGHER SOVIET GRAIN IMPORTS
Grain analysts said the increase ofthree mln tonnes in 1986/87 Soviet grain imports is unlikely toaffect the market Tuesday.    They said the market already has discounted higher Sovietimports, partly on news last month that the Soviet Union boughtone mln tonnes of U.S. corn, and on rumors that the Reaganadministration is pushing for authority to sell the SovietsU.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.    In its supply-demand report, the USDA raised its estimatefor 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln.
    "That was business already done, for all practicalpurposes," said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson,reflecting similar statements made by other analysts. Reuter

FROST NOT EXPECTED TO DAMAGE POLAND'S WHEAT
Poland's winter wheat is likely tosurvive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not beknown until late April, the Polish meteorology institute said.    Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can surviveground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C, SpokesmanTeresa Tomaszewska told Reuters.    Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainlymelted in February, air temperatures down to minus 30 C shouldnot be harmful, she said, but added that wheat can still bedamaged by cold spells in March and April, when young shootsmay be exposed to night frosts.

RENEWAL OF U.S./USSR GRAIN PACT SAID UNCERTAIN
Prospects for renewal of thefive-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at thispoint, a Soviet trade official told Reuters.    The current trade imbalance between the United States andthe Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increasedworld grain production make a renewal of the supply agreementnext year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy traderepresentative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview.    The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988.
    Melnikov said that world grain markets are different thanwhen the first agreement was signed in 1975.    Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials haveindicate that a long term grains agreement might not be asattractive for both sides as it once was.    "We have had one agreement.
 We have had a second agreement,but with the second agreement we've had difficulties withprices," Melnikov said.    "I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the futureabout the agreement..
.. I do not want to speculate on what willhappen after Sept 30, 1988," he said.
    Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Sovietgovernment officials that they would be pushing for a renewalof the agreement.    "The situation is different in comparison to three, five orten years ago ..
. We can produce more," he said. Reuter

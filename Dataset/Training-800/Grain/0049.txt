ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC
The size of French 1986/87 carryoverbarley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French CerealsIntervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.    He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at theend of February from the previous month while export forecastswere lowered to 4.
5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.    Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding alarger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets areopened for French barley a large amount could be put intointervention.
    A small amount of French barley has already been put intointervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.    The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exportsto non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in1985/86.    The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decisionto hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.

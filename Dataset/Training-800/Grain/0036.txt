AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA
The Australian Government will likelyreimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, thedepartment said the sharp fall in world wheat prices hasreduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levelsinsufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated ataround 98 dlrs per tonne.     For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.
5mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below thebreakeven export price, it said.    Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advancepayment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculatedat 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the currentyear and the two lowest of the previous three years, thedepartment said.
    In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling andstorage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.    But the department said the Australian Bureau ofAgricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production willdrop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.
5 mln in1989/90.    The decline will result from low world grain prices leadingto shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.wheat exports, the department said. Reuter

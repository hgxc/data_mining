GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH
A study on grain certificates due outshortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could showthat certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more thancash outlays, administration and industry sources said.    Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the AgricultureDepartment and the Office of Management and Budget suggeststhat certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO officialtold Reuters.    GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specificrequest of Sen.
 Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of thesenate agriculture committee.    The report, which will focus on the cost of certificatescompared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.    The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends onthe program's impact on the USDA loan program.
    If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loanentries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost ofthe program would go up. However, if it is determined thatcertificates have caused the government grain stockpile todecrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.    GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificatesprogram should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.
    But a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fireagainst certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increasein the certificate program," an agricultural consultant said.    The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,while USDA remains firmly committed to it. Reuter

LYNG SAYS TOO LATE FOR CROP DECOUPLING THIS YEAR
U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said it is too late to implement a full 0/92 acreageprovision, or "decoupling," for 1987 grain crops.    "I think there's a chance we'll see that legislation (0/92)passed, (but) not for 1987 crops. It's too late," Lyng told theNational Grain and Feed Association convention here.
    Lyng added that there seems some support in Congress for0/92 and there was a good chance a pilot 0/92 program will bepassed as part of a pending disaster bill.    But he indicated that it is already too late in the year toalter the 1987 crop program. Sign-up for spring crops closesthe end of this month.
    Overall, Lyng predicted very little change will belegislated in the 1985 farm bill this year. Reuter

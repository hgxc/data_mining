OFFICIAL INQUIRY SET FOR AUSTRALIAN WHEAT INDUSTRY
The government's industry aid andprotection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission(IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheatindustry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said.    The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistanceto the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid,he said in a statement.    He said the inquiry will be the first step in settingmarketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when theunderwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat MarketingAct expire.
    Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a fullexamination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.    "The inquiry will be required to take into account changeswhich have taken place in the industry as a result of theagricultural policies of major wheat producing countries andthe industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,"he said.    "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry,as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to triggerunderwriting support from the government for the first time," hesaid.
    Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of theguaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the AustralianWheat Board near the start of the season.    The IAC's report will be due at the same time as thefindings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage,Handling and Transport, Kerin said.    He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow itsfindings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered inlater negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between thefederal and state governments and the industry.

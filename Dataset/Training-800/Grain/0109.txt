USDA RAISES SOVIET GRAIN IMPORT ESTIMATE
The U.S. Agriculture Departmentincreased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes.    In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA saidthe increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to theU.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat andcoarse grain from other major suppliers.    USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up onemln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below thepreliminary 1985/86 figure.
    Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mlntonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along witha dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and acold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.    USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightlyfrom the previous January's level, while milk productionincreased by nearly six pct.
    Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases inroughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestockproduction from expanding as much as it did a year earlier,USDA said. Reuter

35mln a year ago, the Thai Rice Mills Association said.    It said a joint field survey late last month by theassociation, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailandindicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region islower than expected because of a drought in several provinces.    The association said rice growing areas in NakhonRatchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam wereespecially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of1986.
    It said last November that the drought reduced totalnational areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares thisyear, down from 8.84 mln a year ago.

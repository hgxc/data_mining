CANADA RULING ON U.S. CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK
The Canadian government is expectedto announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. cornexports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S.government and farm group representatives said.    The deadline for a final determination is March 7.    U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in asimilar case covering European pasta imports.
 In that case,Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of theCanadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. cornexports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.    Canada slapped a 1.
05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. cornimports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts lastmonth because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated. Reuter

U.S.-SOVIET GRAIN ACCORD QUESTIONED BY LYNG
U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he was not sure a long-term U.S.-Soviet grainagreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.    "It hasn't been worth much in the last two years..
..Theyhaven't lived up to the agreement as I see it," Lyng said in aninterview with Reuters.
    "It would be my thought that it's not worth any effort towork out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement tobe a one-sided thing," he said.    However, Lyng said he did not want to make a "definitivecommitment one way or another at this point."    Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed tobuy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mlntonnes each of corn and wheat.
    Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes ofwheat during the third agreement year, which ended lastSeptember, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.    Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscowwould buy this year.
    "I've seen people making comments on that and I don't knowhow they know, unless they talk to the Soviets," he said. "I haveno knowledge, and I really don't think anyone other than theSoviets have any knowledge."    Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn lastmonth because "they needed it and because the price was right.
"    "Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. And I thinkthey've always found that our corn was good," he said. Reuter

U.S. WHEAT GROWERS WANT EEP TO SOVIET UNION
The U.S. National Association ofWheat Growers (NAWG) urged the Reagan administration offer theSoviet Union wheat under the export enhancement program (eep).    In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, NAWGstated its "strong support" for an eep offer to Moscow.    "We believe that a solid case continues to exist for SovietEEP eligibility, and the recently announced and reported Sovietpurchases of U.S. corn indicate a Soviet willingness topurchase U.S. grain if it is competitively priced," NAWG said.
    "Consequently, we believe it is important to renew the U.S.eep offer and do all that is reasonably possible to ensuremutual adherence to the terms of the U.S.-Soviet grainagreement," the letter said. Reuter

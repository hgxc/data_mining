U.S. SENATE PANEL MAKES CONSERVATION EXEMPTION
The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committeeapproved a measure that would exempt farmers who plantedalfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and1985 from a federal conservation requirement.    Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb.
, said his bill would restoreequity under federal sodbuster rules, which currently deny farmprogram benefits to farmers who, between 1981 and 1985, plantedalfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes withoutinterrupting the plantings with a row crop.    An official from a leading conservation group, who askednot to be identified, said the panel's move was "an unfortunatefirst action" because it could lead to the exemption ofpotentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations,established under the 1985 farm bill.

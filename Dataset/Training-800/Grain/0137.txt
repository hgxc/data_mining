U.S. TO ASK FOR SHARE OF JAPAN'S RICE MARKET
U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice marketto U.S. exporters when he visits that country next month.    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said the Reaganadministration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on U.S. beefand citrus exports.    Lyng, who plans to be in Japan April 14-27, said he willnot ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market.
 "We will urgethat they consider sharing their rice market," he said.    The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of theJapanese rice market the U.S. would request. "We've got none ofit now.
 If we got one per cent of it, it would be a bigimprovement," he said.    Last year, the Reagan administration rejected a petition bythe U.S. rice industry seeking relief from Japanese importrestrictions.    However, the U.S. said it would reexamine the issue if bymid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to U.S. riceexports.
    Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiationsnext month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas, butthat his visit "may be a forerunner in a general way" to talksprior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988.    He said, however, that the U.S. "will ask for a definiteliberalization of those items (beef and citrus)..
.. When youtranslate 'liberalization' into Japanese, it means do away withthe quota.

FINAL 50/50 CORN CERTS SEEN AT 1.6 BILLION DLRS
The Agriculture Department will haveto release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kindcertificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDAdecides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgraindeficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said.    Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available tofeed grain producers in October.
 Wheat deficiency payments forthe 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated theywant to do the same for feedgrains.    Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.
0 billion in corndeficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final paymentmust be 1.
6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split.    However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs ofdeficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs,doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.    Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitationfrom the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another hugerelease of certs onto the market.
    Bills are pending in Congress to move up the finalfeedgrain deficiency payment to "as soon as five months afterharvest as possible," rather than the current year lag time.    Neither Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill.
) nor Sen. Bob Dole(R-Kans.), sponsors of the bills, have brought the legislationforward.
 Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions. Reuter

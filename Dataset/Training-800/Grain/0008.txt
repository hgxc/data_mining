RELIEF TO U.S. CORN/OATS GROWERS SAID LIKELY
U.S. farmers who in the past havegrown oats for their own use but failed to certify to thegovernment that they had done so probably will be allowed tocontinue planting that crop and be eligible for corn programbenefits, an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.    Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn programbenefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops tothe acreage base for that crop.    Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained thatfarmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grownoats for their own use in the past now are being asked to haltoats production or lose corn program benefits.
    USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oatsbut not extend the exemption to all farmers, Lyng's aide said. Reuter

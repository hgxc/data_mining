CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES
The Canadian Wheat Board has advisedthe federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid tofarmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop yearbeginning August 1, a board spokesman said.    The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommendedprice drops but said it would not be good news for westernCanadian grain growers.    "They're all lower," he said.
 "This is really gettingpretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survivaland whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."    Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board willrecommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.
    Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain isdelivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.    If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, thefarmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. Ifprices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.
    The final decision on the initial prices, usually made inApril, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and thefederal cabinet.    Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27pct but last fall the government announced a one billionCanadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.    But federal agricultural officials have already warnedfarmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.

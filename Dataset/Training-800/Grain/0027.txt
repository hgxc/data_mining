YUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA
There was no evidence of winterkillin Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a linerunning northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S.Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a fieldreport.    The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence ofdelayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fallbecause of dry conditions.    However warm temperatures over the past three weeks havepromoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up onlast fall's late seeding, it said.
    Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about thesituation because warm temperatures have brought the grain outof dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, thereport said.    Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damageunder these conditions, they said.    The report said all wheat farmers contacted during thefield trip were optimistic about the crop and the way itemerged from winter.

), the groups issued astatement saying lawmakers should "resist efforts to overhaulthe 15-month-old law, which is operating in its first cropmarketing year."    The farm groups included the American Farm BureauFederation, American Soybean Association, National Cattlemen'sAssociation, National Corn Growers Association, National CottonCouncil, National Pork Producers Council and the U.S. RiceProducers Legislative Group.    The statement said Congress should not modify the 1985 farmbill "so the law might have its intended impact of makingagriculture more competitive in export markets while at thesame time maintaining farm income.
"    "We strongly believe American farmers now needpredictability and certainty in farm legislation in order tohave any opportunity of making proper production and marketingdecisions," the groups said. Reuter

IZVESTIA SAYS SOVIET WINTER CROPS NEED RESEEDING
The government daily Izvestia said aconsiderable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseededand the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes willnot be easy to fulfil.    Without giving figures, the newspaper said: "A considerablepart of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that createsextra effort in the fields in spring."    The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares ofwinter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill.
    A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington hassaid the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pctof the total winter crop and would be the second highestwinterkill in 10 years.    "The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnesof grain is not simple," Izvestia said.    This week's sudden fall in temperatures has affected largeparts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in theUkraine, it said, adding that temperatures fell to as low asminus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia.

WORLD GRAIN TRADE RECOVERY MAY BE UNDERWAY
World grain trade could be turningthe corner and heading toward recovery in the 1986-87 season, aCargill, Inc. analyst said.    Writing in the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin, DavidRogers of Cargill's Commodity Marketing Division cited agradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months, with a slowrise in wheat prices after recent historic lows.
    He said the wheat trade, because wheat can be produced inmany nations, is a good barometer of world grain trade andcould lead to more activity in other grain markets.    Rogers said that with world grain prices at their lowestlevel in over a quarter of a century in real terms, demand hasbegun to rise while producing nations are re-examining theirexpensive price-support policies and reducing planted acres.

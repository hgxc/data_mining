U.S. CONGRESS TO LOOK AT SOIL PROGRAM EXEMPTIONS
The Senate Agriculture Committee isexpected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt fromgovernment conservation regulations those farmers who haverotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes withrow crops, committee staff said.    Under current so-called "sodbuster" law, farmers who plantedalfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highlyerodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farmprogram benefits if they produce a row crop on that land inlater years.    Sen.
 Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.), sponsor of the measure, saidrecently that those crop rotating practices resulted in lesserosion than the practices of many farmers who producedstrictly row crops. Reuter

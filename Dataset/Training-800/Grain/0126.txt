BIG U.S. CONSERVATION ENROLLMENT EXPECTED
Enrollment in the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's fourth conservation signup is expected to beannounced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may behigher than total enrollment for the first three signups.    Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres,USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far inthe 10-year conservation program is 8.
9 mln acres.    Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres intothe program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA'sAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at acongressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will beaccepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.
    As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area isexpected to attract the greatest enrollment.    "The Great Plains area will be the predominate area whichwe'll get signup in," a USDA conservation specialist said.    Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of theacreage pulled from that area, he said.
    Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreagein the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production,but the USDA source said this would be a relatively smallpercent of the total.    A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll partof their corn base acreage into the program has sparked moreinterest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.    Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to takeland out of production for 10 years.
 The average rent paymentaccepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre. Reuter

U.S OIL TAX WOULD NOT AFFECT PDVSA-CHAMPLIN DEAL
an eventual oil import fee in theunited states will make no difference to champlin petroleumcorp's joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos devenezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said.    "this was an aspect which was discussed at length during thenegotiations, but we can say our contract covers alleventualities in this regard," he told reuters during thesigning ceremony here.    Venezuela's energy and mines minister arturo hernandezgrisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsabuys 50 pct of champlin's corpus christi refinery, as "one morestep in the maturation and presence of our oil industry inworld markets.
"   union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement willbe beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source ofsupply with a modern refinery and access to markets.    "we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a timeof protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there areclear benefits to both sides," he said.    Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even withan oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily overthe years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelanheavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities andobtain a competitive product yield.
    "therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been aconsideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seenwhat such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impacton today's agreement," adams said.    He said the refinery could run crude as heavy asvenezuela's bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without anydifficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier dietto take advantage of bigger margins.    The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd ofvenezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pctyield of white products.

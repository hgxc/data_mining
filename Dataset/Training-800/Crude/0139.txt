BRAZIL CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA
Brazil's state-oil company,Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from SaudiArabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guaranteesfrom the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said.    Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference theSaudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose suchconditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment ofits commercial debts last month.    The shipment of 2.
2 mln barrels represents two days of oilconsumption in Brazil.    But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds anddecide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobraswill lift the order to cancel the shipment.    Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms byMonday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.
    "Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be muchbetter for us, because with the market prices more or less thesame, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage," he said.    Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importingBrazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothingfrom Brazil, he said.
    Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industryworkers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobrasoil stocks are "reasonably balanced."     Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, withan average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000bpd.
 China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.    "If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, Iam sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offersfrom elsewhere," Santana added. Reuter

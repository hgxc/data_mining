ECUADOR DEPUTY MINISTER SEEKS OIL AID IN VENEZUELA
Ecuador's deputy energy ministerFernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks onfurther Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industryfollowing last week's earthquake, officials said.    Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for anexpected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles ofpipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port ofBalao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.
    Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lendEcuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.    The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports thatVenezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota,set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987.    "All options are open at this moment in the context ofcooperation on oil production," a Venezuelan energy and minesministry source said.
    Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula tocompensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while thepipeline is repaired, officials said.    Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and minesminister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks attechnical level, officials said.    Industry sources said that among the options are forVenezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuelaand non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supplyEcuador's Far Eastern clients.
    But the ministry source said that no decision has yet beenreached on the matter, and that an announcement would be madein due course.    Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would haveto import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet itsneeds until the line was repaired.    Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teransaid last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair thedamage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake.

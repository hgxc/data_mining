SHEARSON LEHMAN UPGRADES U.S. OIL STOCKS
Analyst Sanford Margoshes of ShearsonLehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stockstoday now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded inholding to its prescribed production quotas.    "It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quotarestraint, will boost the price of oil," Margoshes said.    Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response tohigher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas.
 Margoshessaid he recommends Imperial Oil <IMO.A>, up 1/2 to 49-1/8,Standard Oil Co <SRD>, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon <XON> one to83-1/8, and Chevron <CHV> 1-1/8 to 54-7/8.    In addition, Margoshes said he recommended AtlanticRichfield <ARC> on a short-term basis, though he said he isstill suspect about its debt situation. Atlantic Richfield rose1-3/4 to 77.
    He said "the market could come down to test the 16 dlr abarrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil ispositive right now. Before the year is out we will see higheroil prices."    He noted that belief that the government is interested inraising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oilstocks today.

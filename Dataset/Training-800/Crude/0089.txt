API PRESIDENT SEES OPTIONS TO AVERT OIL CRISIS
American Petroleum Institute PresidentCharles DiBona said no options should be rejected to combat growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.    "No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas,floor prices, tax incentives or other alternatives--while anational dialogue on the issue continues," DiBona said at a paper institute conference in New York today.    DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry onhow to stimulate energy production but there is consensus onremoving several government policies that hinder investments innew prospects.
    DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolishedimmediately and current proposals for increased environmentalregulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be notadopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National WildlifeRefuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oilcompanies, DiBona said.    "This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if thenation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil," DiBonasaid.
 Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen whileconsumption rose and that has raised dependence on importedoil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said.    Reuter

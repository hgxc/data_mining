BRAZILIAN BANK WORKERS DECIDE ON NATIONAL STRIKE
Brazilian bank workers votedto launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labourunrest arising from the failure of the government'santi-inflation plan.    At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of SaoPaulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met.    Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the nationalconfederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unionsrepresenting 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinitestoppage would affect all banks.
    The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its thirdweek and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against thestate-owned petroleum company Petrobras.    The government ordered thousands of troops into therefineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation, but thetroops were removed yesterday.    Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal becausethe refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated theirwillingess to negotiate next Wednesday.
 The government has alsosent marines into the main ports.    A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio deJaneiro said unions were studying an offer by privateshipowners for a 120 pct pay rise.    Seamen employed by two small companies have alreadyaccepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about5,000 seamen employed by Petrobras.

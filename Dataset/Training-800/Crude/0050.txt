EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING
OPEC crude oil output in the first fewdays of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpdceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.
    The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oiltraders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the MiddleEast, Africa, Latin America and Asia.    They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that thegroup is producing within its ceiling to support the return toa fixed price system, which came into effect last month.    OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpdabove the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by theUnited Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.
    The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,was also producing above quota in the first days of March, thesurvey reveals.    But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fallin Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability toexport as much as its quota allows.    Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.
466 mln bpd and produced1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.    Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to3.
1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,against a 4.133 mln bpd quota.
 The Saudi figures include a200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.    Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, wasestimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.
15 inearly March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its shareof Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.    Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by someOPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,both substantially under quota in February and early March.    Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.
    Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"sprices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for anyshortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.    Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, downfrom 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.
238 mln bpd.    Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonnygrades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudesfrom the U.K. North Sea.    Country-by-country production figures are as follows, inmln bpd - COUNTRY        CURRENT        FEBRUARY    QUOTA ALGERIA        0.

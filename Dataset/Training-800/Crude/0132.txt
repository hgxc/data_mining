HOUSE SPEAKER BACKS OIL IMPORT FORECAST PLAN
House Speaker Jim Wright endorsed aproposal to require the president to take action to reduce oilimports if they threaten to top 50 pct of U.S. consumption.    Wright told reporters the plan by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, afellow Texas Democrat, was positive and useful.
 Oil importspeaked in 1977 at 47 pct, were short of 36 pct last year andthis year are up over 40 pct, Bentsen said.     The Bentsen proposal, supported by 24 other Senators, wouldwould require the president to issue annual three-year oilimport forecasts. In any year they threatened to top 50 pct, hewould be ordered to propose quotas or other solution.

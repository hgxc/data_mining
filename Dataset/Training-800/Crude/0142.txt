VENEZUELA TO LEND ECUADOR 50,000 BPD OF CRUDE
Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to helpit meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines MinisterArturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.    He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during avisit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy MinisterFernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan inAugust.    Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way tooffsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused byearthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.
    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipelineconnecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balaowas put out of action.    Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador'sis 210,000 bpd.
 Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC toallow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when thepipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.    Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrelsshipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador thisweekend to help meet domestic consumption needs.    The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan byVenezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries.
    "If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of thiscountry would have ground to a halt," he said. Reuter

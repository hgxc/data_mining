up to 300 people were feared dead and morethan 15,000 people left homeless by thursday's earthquake,which will cost Ecuador close to 800 mln dlrs in lost petroleumrevenues, authorities said.    They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipelineat 150 mln dlrs.    "the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake isgigantic," president leon febres cordero said after inspectingthe damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 milesfrom here.
    The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing thisopec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, presidentfebres cordero said in a statement issued today by thepresidential press office.    The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crudeexports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. Itwould cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carriesoil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacificocean port.
    Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds ofecuador's exports.    the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico riverwhich burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napoprovince, health minister jorge brancho told reuters.    "we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there isno way of now knowing the exact figure because many people havedisappeared," he said.
    Other estimates ranged as high as 500 dead.    So far 20 corpses have been recovered, bracho said.    Information Minister Marco Lara told reporters: "the numberof dead and injured is not known .
.. because we do not know howmany people lived in the homes hit by the landslides.

IRAN SELLING DISCOUNTED CRUDE, JAPAN TRADERS SAY
Japanese customers have bought nearly sixmln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company(NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, andWestern traders have received even larger discounts, Japanesetraders involved in the transactions told Reuters.    NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanesecustomers with different formulas. One company has bought800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.
    Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman andDubai spot prices less a discount, they said.    Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed toreverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spotmarkets, oil traders said.    Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colderweather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output wasbelow its self-imposed quota of 15.
8 mln barrels per day.    Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullishsentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures marketare supporting spot price levels, they said.    Another Japanese trading house has paid the official pricebut through a processing arrangement will effectively receive adiscount, the sources said.
 "It's just disguised cheating," oneJapanese trader said.    The sources said only one Japanese company had paid theofficial price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.
5 mlnbarrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining inSingapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude havebeen sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on theofficial price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of theprice related to processing arrangements.

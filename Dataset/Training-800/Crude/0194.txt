U.S. OIL TAX BREAK PROPOSAL TO BE EXAMINED
The White House said a proposal fora tax break for the oil industry would undergo review.    Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan had noposition on recommendations submitted by Energy Secretary JohnHerrington to encourage investment in the hard hit domestic oilindustry.    But Fitzwater noted that Reagan did have a fundamentalobjection to tax rises and special tax breaks.
    He said that even though Herrington's recommendation didnot agree with existing policy, "We'll take a look at it."    The review will be undertaken by the president's DomesticPolicy Council.    Herrington's proposal was reported by the Washington Postto have been made in a letter to Reagan submitting a study thatfound the United States would be importing half of its oil bythe 1990s, threatening U.S. national security.

Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitmentsand its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and MinesMinister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipelineconnecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port ofBalao was damaged last week by an earthquake.
    Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for atotal of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet exportcommitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crudeand provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said.
     Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed itsexports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task thatwould take an estimated five  months.    Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude forrefining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador wouldrepay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.
    Both countries are the only Latin American members of theOrganisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).    Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before theearthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total outputwas around 260,000 bpd.

HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY CALL FOR OIL TAX BENEFITS
Energy Secretary John Herringtonsaid he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oilindustry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil andhead off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.    He said also at a news conference that he would recommendto the White House that the fill rate of the StrategicPetroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrelsper day.    The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels aday.
    Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill ratefor the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept downbecause of budgetary constraints.    Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he mightadvocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in taxbenefits for oil and gas exploration and for research anddevelopment into new ways to extract oil which is nowconsidered uneconomical to produce.    He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of theEnergy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.
    Herrington said that before he disclosed whatrecommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industryhe might make, he would raise the matter with the White HouseEconomic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increaseoil production made good tax policy.    He said he would like to increase U.S. production by onemln barrels a day.    The report said that by the end of the century the UnitedStates may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oilconsumption, posing a serious economic and national securitythreat.

PARIBAS SEEKING TO ADJUST ECUADOR OIL FACILITY
Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the countryrecover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.    But the French bank's plan, which would effectivelypostpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for severalmonths, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52members of the loan syndicate.    The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports wasruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five monthsto repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.
    President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated totaldamages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said thatEcuador as a result would maintain January's suspension ofinterest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.    Payments were halted in January because of the drop in theprice of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador'sexport earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.    Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in theParibas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a jobfor international financial organizations and not forcommercial banks, bankers said.
    The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed lastOctober 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for aLatin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted inAugust 1982.    Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel stronglythat the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, theyfear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditionsfor Latin borrowers will be set back.
    "There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feelit's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of arestructuring would look bad," one banker commented. Reuter

OPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING, SUBROTO SAYS
Opec remains within its agreed outputceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected currentfluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, IndonesianEnergy Minister Subroto said.    He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto thatpresent weakness in the spot oil market was the result ofwarmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand foroil.
    Prices had also been forced down because refineries wereusing up old stock, he said.    He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed productionceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied:"Below 15.
8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate.    He said there appeared to have been some attempts tomanipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by thecartel's December pricing agreement it would get throughpresent price difficulties.
    He predicted that prices would recover again in the thirdand fourth quarters of 1987.    He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergencyOpec meeting.    He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in thespot price.
 "We hope the weak price will be overcome, andpredict the price will be better in the third and fourthquarters."    Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stockdeliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the priceto fall. But Opec would get through this period if membersstuck together.

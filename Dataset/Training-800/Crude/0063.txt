IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD
OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrelsper day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln theprevious month and an overall 17.
3 mln bpd in fourth quarter1986, the International Energy Agency said.    A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the productionquotas set at their last conference in December, but liftingswere reduced from several countries, it said in its latestmonthly oil market report.    These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance tofixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly forfixed volumes over an extended period.

    The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks onIranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed pricesapparently cut February production.    It said Iraqi exports are about 1.

SOUTH AFRICAN FIRM TO CONTINUE TESTS
South Africa's state-owned energyfirm Soekor said it would continue tests after striking oilsome 120 kms (75 miles) south-southwest of Mossel Bay.    During production tests, about 5,000 barrels of oil andfive mln cubic feet of gas per day were produced, it said.    "This oil discovery will be followed-up as soon as possibleby further seismic surveys and drilling.
 Should furtherdrilling and tests in the area yield positive results oilproduction from a floating platform could be considered."    Director General of Mineral and Energy Affairs Louw Albertsannounced the strike earlier but said it was uneconomic. Reuter

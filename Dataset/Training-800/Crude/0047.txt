OPEC countries are all sticking firmly toofficial crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices islikely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Ministerof Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters.    Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference,blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply anddemand. "If we stick to the production limitation, the thirdquarter will be in better balance.
"    He said the market is in a period of transition while theimpact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fixprices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through.    Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council(GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crudeoil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices,Subroto said: "Apparently they have taken care of that."    "They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves.
 I thinkthey'll help each other," he said.    Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's PriceDifferentials Committee he did not know why the meeting hadbeen postponed from its scheduled April 2 date.    "Maybe they find it is better not to have the meetingbecause .
.. Everyone is sticking to official prices," he said.

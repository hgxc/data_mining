STUDY PREDICTS U.S. DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL
A government study has concluded theU.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into thenext century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability,the New York Times said.    The newspaper said the inter-agency government study founda serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily fallingdomestic production and rising demand for imported oil.    The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relyingon foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peakof 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate duringthe 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
    The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said.    It said recommendations sent to the White House by EnergySecretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raisedomestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from thecurrent 8.4 mln barrels.
    The newspaper said the administration has placed increasedemphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now heldis that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in timesof shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day,rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget.   The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring thedepletion allowance to major producers.
    "The administration also plans to renew its efforts to...
Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling onthe outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits theuse of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers," it added.    The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahomaas saying the study greatly underestimated potential U.S.Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimatedthe amount of domestic oil which would be produced.

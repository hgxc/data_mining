ECUADOR BEGINS WORK ON OIL PIPELINE TO COLOMBIA
Construction workers today began buildinga 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador's jungle oilfieldsto a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude couldbe pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitryofficials said.    They said it would take about two months and at least 15mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador toPuerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombianpipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia'sPacific Ocean coast.    The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed totransport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) ofEcuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said.
    The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room forEcuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadoreanenergy ministry official said.    The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped byboat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domesticdemand.
    The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador toresume some of production, paralysed since March six by an earthquake the night before.    The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungleoilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the PacificOcean.    Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before theearthquake.
 It would take about five months to repair thepipeline to Balao, government officials said.    Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mlndlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake,energy ministry Javier Espinosa said.    Reuter

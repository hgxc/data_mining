SAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION
Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuringother members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries to stay within their production quotas, said MorganStanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.    Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oilengineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations toattempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several yearsto keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.    "Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concertedeffort by the Saudis to get production down," Wellemeyer said.
    "The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs abarrel) and are willing to make it happen again," he said.    In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs abarrel level on market reports of some OPE members producingabove their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mlnbarrels per day.
 But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on abelief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.    Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil productioncould push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day asearly as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.    Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oilshould strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed theorganization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs abarrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users fromswitching to natural gas supplies.

U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL
A White House-ordered report said that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000could have potentially damaging implications for nationalsecurity.    The Energy Department study discusses several options tocurb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruledout a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to helpthe depressed domestic oil industry.
    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that"although we have made gains in energy security in the last sixyears, this report shows that there is justification fornational concern both over declining competitiveness of ourdomestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreignoil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing adetermination that the country never again become captive to aforeign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages andsharp prices increases of the 1970s.    The report said an import fee would raise prices and helpmake it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce newoil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax woulddepress the nation's economy. reuter

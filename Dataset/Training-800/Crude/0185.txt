U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88
The U.K. Government forecasts that oilrevenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in1985/86.
    The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement andBudget Report issued after the Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.    The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oilrevenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remainingclose to current levels, the Treasury document said.    The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall willreflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporationtax is paid after a time lag.
    The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel differencein oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mlnstg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a fullyear.    Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes inproduction would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.
    Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are nowestimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,despite a shortfall of 1.
25 billlion in oil receipts.    Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billionstg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of theovershoot.
    Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.
    Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.
3 billion,compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion thisfiscal year.    The general government expenditure for the coming fiscalyear is expected to total 173.
5 billion stg, up from a revised164.9 billion in the current year.    A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market andoverseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total PublicSector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.
9 billion stg in1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasurysaid. REUTER

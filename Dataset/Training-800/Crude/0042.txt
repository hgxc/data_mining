TEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS
Texas Railroad Commissioner JamesNugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait forCongress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adoptincentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severancetaxes on oil produced from stripper wells.    Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house ofrepresentatives that the state must take the initiative inmolding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assisttroubled oil producers.    His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exemptstripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each dayfrom the state's 4.
6 pct severance tax. He said that themajority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper wellcategory and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can becrucial in determining if the well remains in production.    Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt newwildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five yearsas a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.
    Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods ofproduction that inject water or gas into the ground to recoveroil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugentsaid. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiarywells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a dayfor three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 abarrel.    "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federaladministrations to develop a coherent energy policy for thenation to follow.
 I say we have waited long enough," Nugentsaid. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead,follow, or get out of the way."    Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasuryby exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxeswould be more than made up by stimulating new business for theoil supply and service industry.

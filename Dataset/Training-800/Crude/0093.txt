SAUDI ARABIA'S KING FAHD WANTS STABLE OIL PRICES
King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wantsoil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers toavoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group.    His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the televisionnews agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will maketo Britain later this month.    King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be preparedto reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.
133 mlnbarrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark priceagreed to by OPEC last December.    The King replied: "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices byitself but certainly desires price stability."    Non-OPEC countries "must help us in a framework of commoninterest so that there is no type of competition which couldprove harmful to everyone," he said.
    Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a firststep towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was notfor Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine suchissues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higherbenchmark.    In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure,due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members.
 King Fahdsaid Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, wasadhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference whichset a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.    A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted thegroup's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.
    The King also urged the world community to help thePalestinians return to their homeland and called for a peacefulend to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not beresolved on the battlefield, he said. REUTER

STUDY GROUP URGES INCREASED U.S. OIL RESERVES
A study group said the United Statesshould increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mlnbarrels as one way to deal with the present and future impactof low oil prices on the domestic oil industry.    U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect theeconomy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.    The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a privategroup, also called for new research for oil exploration anddevelopment techniques.
    It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs abarrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, withimports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.    The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: toprotect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other suchdevice or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil.    But the group did not strongly back either option, sayingthere were benefits and drawbacks to both.
    It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reservesand more exploration and development research would help toguard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports. Reuter

PETROBRAS ASKS ARMY TO WITHDRAW TROOPS
Brazil's state-oil companyPetrobras has asked the Army to withdraw the troops which wereoccupying its oil installations since Tuesday, Petrobras saidin a statement.    The statement said the request for the withdrawal of thetroops was made because of the calmness reigning in all of itsrefineries.    "The request was also due to the end of the seamen's strikeand the willingness of the oil industry workers to sit again bythe negotiating table," the statement said.
    Even though the Petrobras statement said the seamen'sstrike was over, a union spokesman said only two small shippingcompanies had reached a pay agreement. The overwhelmingmajority of Brazil's seamen remained on strike.    The statement said a meeting between Petrobras and oilindustry leaders was set for next Wednesday in Rio, with thepresence of Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto as a mediator.
    Petrobras said the request for the withdrawal of the troopswas made at 1100 local hours (1400 GMT), but a companyspokesman said he did not know if the troops had already beenremoved. Reuter

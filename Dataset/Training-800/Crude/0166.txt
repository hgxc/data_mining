ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN
President Leon Febres Cordero saidEcuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to makepayments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would haveto be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.    Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake wasforcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on theslide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments toprivate foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16billion dlr foreign debt.
    "All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," thepresident said during a visit to the quake zone. "A governmentas a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain."    Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oilwould have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be ableto meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.
    He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrsa barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.    Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and aprice freeze on key consumer goods as a result of theearthquake, which killed at least 300 people.    Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget wouldbe cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen andsalaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet,would be reduced.
    He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basicconsumer items, mainly food staples, while the price ofgasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fareswould rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited. Reuter

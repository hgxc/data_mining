DOE SECRETARY FAVORS HIGHER SPR FILL RATE
Energy Secretary John Herringtonsaid he believes the Reagan Administration will review itsdecision to cut the fill rate of the Strategic PetroleumReserve because of a department report issued yesterday warningof growing U.S. dependence on oil imports.    "As part of this study, I think the Administration willtake the fill rate under review," Herrington said at a HouseEnergy subcommittee hearing.    The Administration has proposed cutting the fill rate from75,000 barrels of oil per day to 35,000 bpd in fiscal year 1988to save money.
    "My personal feeling is that is too low. I favor themaximum fill rate (of 100,000 bpd)," Herrington said. Reuter

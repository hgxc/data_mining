SENATE COMMITTEE MAY LOOK AT FUEL TAX PROPOSALS
The Senate budget committee sitsdown tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with thebudget writers expected to look at several proposals for fueltaxes and other tax options to cut the budget.    In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number ofrevenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrsa barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just onimported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energyconsumption based on five pct of value.    Other proposals include various excise taxes andcombinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years.
    The committee, however, will only include revenue numbersin its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions leftto the House and Senate tax-writing committees.     The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, SenLawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise atleast 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind.    The House Budget Committee also plans to start drafting aseparate budget plan later this week, which would have to bereconciled with the Senate version.
 The final budget would bethe fiscal 1988 spending and revenue blueprint. Reuter

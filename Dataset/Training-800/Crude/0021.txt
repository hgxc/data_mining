NYMEX WILL EXPAND OFF-HOUR TRADING APRIL ONE
The New York Mercantile Exchange setApril one for the debut of a new procedure in the energycomplex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.     On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do nothold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes,a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futuresmarket, according to an exchange spokeswoman.    "This will change the way oil is transacted in the realworld," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.
    Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEXprices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at adifferential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.     The expanded program "will serve the industry because theoil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza,secretary of Century Resources Inc.     The rule change, which has already taken effect forplatinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the openinterest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according totraders and analysts.
    Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, calledan exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures positionbefore entering into the transaction.    Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold afutures position before entering into an EFP and one or bothparties can offset their cash transaction with a futurescontract the next day, according to exchange officials.    When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December,NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFPprovision will add to globalization of the energy markets byproviding for, in effect, 24-hour trading.
"    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rulechange in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman. Reuter

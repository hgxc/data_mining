U.S. SENATORS SEEK TO EXPAND USDA EXPORT BONUS
Leading U.S. farm state senators areseeking to insert into the Senate's omnibus trade bill aprovision that would broaden eligibility requirements under theU.S. Agriculture Department's export enhancement program, EEP,to include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, includingthe Soviet Union, Senate staff said.    Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies torecoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair tradingpractices.    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.
)is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort tobroaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to beeligible for the subsidies, sources said.    The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee ChairmanLloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.
), David Pryor(D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.
) --also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield porkproducers and processors from Canadian imports.    The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa),would clarify the definition of "industry" in determining whetheror not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers.
    Grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by theInternational Trade Commission that imports from Canada of liveswine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harmingU.S. producers.    The bill's proponents have argued Canada has simplyreplaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork. Reuter

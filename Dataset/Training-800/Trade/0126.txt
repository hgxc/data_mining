PERU SHORT-TERM TRADE CREDIT UP TO 430 MLN DLRS
Peru's short-term foreign trade creditlines, regarded as vital to ensure smooth foreign commercialtransactions, have more than doubled to 430 mln dollars underthe 20-month government of president Alan Garcia.    Central bank general manager Hector Neyra told reportersmany of the credits were 90-day.    Trade credits were 210 mln dlrs when Garcia took office in1985 announcing a tough stance limiting foreign debt repaymentsto 10 pct of export earnings.
    Neyra told Reuters Peru was current on interest payments onshort-term debt, including trade credit lines and on about 750mln dlrs in so-called  "working capital" credits.    Trade credit lines were 880 mln dlrs in 1982, but fell in1984 when Peru stopped some payments to private foreign banks. Reuter

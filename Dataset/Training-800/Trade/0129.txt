Indonesia cannot spend its way out ofrecession and has very limited economic options due to lowerworld oil prices, Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar wasquoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.    "If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much, such asthrough expansionary monetary and budgetary policies, it mightcreate negative effects not only on price increases, but alsoon the balance of payments," he told bankers and businessmen inthe North Sumatran city of Medan.    Antara quoted him as saying Indonesia is relying on itsexport drive to help narrow its trade deficit.
    Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted tohelp boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries,which are centered in Sumatra.    "I see Sumatra has great potential, as in the plantationsector in which family units are employed in great number," hesaid, according to the agency.    Indonesia relied on oil and gas exports for 70 pct of itsexport revenue until last year's fall in crude prices.

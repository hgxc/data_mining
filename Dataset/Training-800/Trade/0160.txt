JAPAN SAYS IT TRYING TO EXPAND DOMESTIC DEMAND
Japan has assured a meetingof trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domesticdemand and restructure its economy.    Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informalGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that, inaddition to demand boosting measures adopted last September, acomprehensive economic program will be prepared after the1987/88 budget is approved.    Hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting,said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuringthe economy, but did not elaborate.
    Hata said protectionist pressures in the internationaleconomy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits,payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries.    Despite great potential, developing economies are stillconfronted by grave difficulties, particularly debt, he added.    The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declarationlast September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and the subsequenttrade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva.
    "It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitmentto implementing that plan as scheduled," Hata said.    Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiationsin some areas at the expense of others.    In order to rebuild the free trade system, it is importantfor each participant to have domestic policies that will servethis end.
    As part of its contribution, Japan plans in April tofundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences forindustrial and mining products to make Japan's domestic marketmore open to developing countries, he said. REUTER

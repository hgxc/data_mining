BELGIAN SAYS EC WOULD REACT TO TEXTILE BILL
Belgian Foreign Trade Minister HermanDe Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing worldtextile imports the only way the European Community (EC) couldreact was to retaliate.    De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textileimports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe."    And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.
    Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it wasvetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports toprotect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliationU.S. trading partners.    A similar bill has been introducted this year, in aCongress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a Presidentweakened by the Iran scandal.    De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials andCongressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way wecould react would be retaliation, and it would cause moreretaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems.
"    He said if a textile bill was enacted, "we will impose taxeson a lot of American products."  He said "it would be stupid. Wehave to avoid that.
"    He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because ofits massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not withEC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted shipments of Asian textiles.    De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solveEC trade issues, saying "each time we come in contact, it aconflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West.
"    He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials crossthe Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.    "This is not the way to work in a serious way between twobig powers," De Croo said.    reuter

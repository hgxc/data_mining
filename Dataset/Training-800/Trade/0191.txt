U.S. HOUSE PANEL EASES SOVIET EXPORT CONTROLS
The U.S. House Foreign AffairsCommittee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are nowkept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer athreat to U.S. national security.    The Democratic-controlled committee said theadministration's export control policies, which restrictshipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year'srecord 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.    The committee said the legislation will cut government redtape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete withforeign producers since many of the goods are readily availablefrom other countries.
    Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International EconomicPolicy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had costthe U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year.    "This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack thetrade deficit in a positive way by exporting more," theWashington Democrat said.
    The legislation would order the Commerce Department to liftcontrols on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list overthe next three years unless other countries agree to comparablecontrols.    Most of these are of the least sophisticated type oftechnology such as medical instruments.    It would also give the Commerce Department primaryauthority to decide which exports will be permitted and limitthe Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewingrequests to export highly-sensitive technology.

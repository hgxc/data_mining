S.KOREA SAYS JAPAN COMPLAINS TO GATT ON TRADE PLAN
Japan has complained to the secretariatof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that SouthKorea's five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japanbreaks GATT rules, Trade Ministry officials here said.    They said Japan submitted a report earlier this monthalleging South Korea's plan to import less from Japan and morefrom the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creatingnon-tariff trade barriers.    South Korea unveiled the plan in November.
 It said it hopedto narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by1991.    South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45billion dlrs in 1986, and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first twomonths of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period.
    The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not toimport Japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to Japan.    The officials said they believed the Japanese action, onestep short of filing a suit, was designed to bring South Koreato the negotiating table and stop the plan.    The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various importrestrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Koreangoods to help reduce the trade deficit.

EC OFFICIAL FAULTS U.S. TRADE BILL
Sir Roy Denman, Head of the ECDelegation in Washington, said pending U.S. trade legislationis a misguided attempt to deal with the nation's trade deficitand will spark retaliation if passed in its present form.    "To think that you can deal with a trade deficit bylegislation is a mistake," he told the Foreign TradeAssociation here.    Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which hewarned of in a letter to House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on aproduct-for-product basis.
    "Retaliation does not have to be matched product toproduct," Denman said.    He said in the case of textiles import restrictions,however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.    "Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on Europeanexports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likelyto retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports toEurope," Denman said.
    He also took exception to U.S. proposals to requirecountries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. tocut those surpluses or face special tariffs.    "This would conflict with international obligations, throwa large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations andcould easily boomerang," he warned of the tariff proposals.    Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seekreciprocity in specific trade sectors.
    "Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barrierswould simply lead to retaliation from the other party," hesaid, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved bytrading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages inanother. Reuter

JAPAN ALERTS GATT TO SOUTH KOREA IMPORT PLAN
Japan told the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade that South Korea's five-year importdiversification plan violated the spirit of the world tradegoverning body, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.    The notification came in Japan's answer to a recent GATTquestionnaire on unfair trade practices, the spokesman said.    In the five-year plan, which starts this year, South Koreaaims to reduce its dependency on Japan as a source of importedgoods and to increase imports from the U.S. And Europe.
    Japan's move came after several unsuccessful bilateralnegotiations on the plan, the spokesman said. "The notificationdoes not represent anything resembling a formal complaint, noris it intended to pressure South Korea. It is a routineprocedure followed by all other GATT member states.

EC SAYS U.S. BROKE TRADE RULES IN AKZO-DUPONT ROW
The European Community Commission hascharged the United States with breaking international traderules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market andsaid it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT.    In the latest of a series of trade disputes withWashington, the executive authority alleged that a section ofthe U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminatedagainst imported products in favour of domestically-producedgoods.    The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to ruleon whether the section in question, which officials said hadproved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules.    Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measuresif, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed tobring the disputed section into line with international rules.
    The executive's decision to go to GATT follows a complaintto it by the Dutch company Akzo <AKZO.AS>, whose "aramid"synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market becauseof charges by the U.S. Firm <Dupont> that the fibres violatethe American company's patents.    Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S.International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory andincompatible with GATT provisions.    The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of theU.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over importedproducts.
 The EC Commission charged that EC producers did nothave the same possibilities for defending themselves before theITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.    "Consequently the procedure followed..
.Is less favourablethan that which takes places in normal courts of law for goodsproduced in the United States," it said in a statement. Reuter

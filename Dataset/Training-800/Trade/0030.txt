"What we need is a resolution of trade issues, we needvisible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage moreimports and we need greater domestic-led growth.
"    Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year,Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduceits trade surplus, which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986.

FAVORED TRADE STATUS FOR MOSCOW STILL OPPOSED
The Reagan administration wants toencourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does notbelieve Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment,Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said.    "It seems to me that more trade between us is better thanless trade," he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations.    To that end, the administration in January allowed foreignpolicy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to theSoviet Union to lapse, he said.
    Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remainingexport controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibiteditems and speeding up the licensing process, he said.    Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment thatcomes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment.    U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countriesthat restrict emigration and other rights.
    "What we have seen so far (in improved rights under SovietLeader Mikhail Gorbachev) are promising trends," he said.    But, he added: "We don't know if they will continue, wedon't know how significant they will be." Reuter

GATT ROUND MAY STOP GROWING TRADE PROBLEMS: U.S.
A successful new GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed tohalt growing bilateral trade problems between major tradingpartners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.    Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerialtalks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasingbecause the multilateral system is inefficient.    "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATTround," he said.
 "The very existence of all these bilateralirritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateralsolutions to some of these problems."    The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Puntadel Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and serviceswere included in the negotiations for the first time.
    The growing debt burden of Latin American and Africannations will also provide impetus for the GATT round tosucceed, he said. "Clearly those countries need to develop theirexport endeavours and they need open markets for that to happenand that's the basic objective of the new GATT round."    But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour.
 Itwill not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries,but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.    "It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint becausethese debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,"he said.    "They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT roundas a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or makingpossible debt amortisation in the future," he said.

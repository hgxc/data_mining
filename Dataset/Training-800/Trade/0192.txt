BALDRIGE SUPPORTS NIC TALKS ON CURRENCIES
Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigesaid he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrializedcountries (NICS) to revalue currencies that are tied to thedollar in order to help the United States cut its massive tradedeficit.    "We do need to do something with those currencies or wewill be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products,"or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar,Baldrige told a House banking subcommittee.    The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen andEuropean currencies, but has changed very little against thecurrencies of some developing countries such as South Korea andTaiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar.
    As a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar overthe past year and a half have done little to improve the tradedeficits with those countries.    Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that theTreasury Department was attempting to persuade those countriesto reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates. Reuter

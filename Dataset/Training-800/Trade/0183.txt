CANADA OUTLINES GATT AGRICULTURAL REFORM PLAN
Canadian Trade Minister PatCarney said that agricultural policies should not hurt worldinternational trade and should therefore become more priceresponsive over time.    She told delegates at the informal meeting of tradeministers that this was one of five principles Canada wantedadopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agricultureshould avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countriesshould freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures thatdistorted world prices, Carney said.
    Carney said the fourth principle was that countries shouldnot introduce new import barriers not mandated by existinglegislation and the fifth was that these basic principles mustbe implemented collectively.    Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines arebasically compatible with the seven point Australian proposalsannounced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.    European trade sources said the conference welcomed theCanadian initiative but some delegates, and not only theEuropean Community, voiced reservations about some of theprinciples.
    Carney said there was a lot of political will among theministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in underfour years and that there is also a realisation that it has tobe done in a balanced way.    "The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on abroad front and see what areas emerge where we can get earlyconclusion," she said.    However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are,Carney said.
  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral tradenegotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form byOctober, are progressing well. REUTER

INDONESIA'S NON-OIL EXPORTS DECLINE IN 1986
Indonesia's non-oil and gas exportsfell to 5.79 billion dlrs in calendar 1986 from 5.98 billion in1985, according to Bank Indonesia figures.
    Coffee exports rose to 753 mln dlrs from 580 mln in 1985,but rubber shipments fell to 625 mln from 720 mln and tin to180.6 mln from 246 mln, weekly central bank figures show.    Indonesia hopes to boost its non-oil exports to make up foroil revenue lost because of lower prices.
 But the lower valueof commodities such as timber, rubber, palm oil and tea onworld markets has prevented this, despite a 31 pct devaluationof the rupiah against the dollar in September. REUTER

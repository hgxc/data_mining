DUTCH OFFICIAL WARNS OF MORE TRADE CONFLICTS
Already strained relations betweenthe U.S. And the European Community (EC) are likely to getworse before they get better, director general of the DutchEconomics Ministry's foreign affairs division Frans Engeringsaid.    Speaking at an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in TheHague, Engering noted the developing history of crises oversteel, citrus and pasta, and warned of more to come.    "I consider the strident tone of US declarations on Airbusill-advised, and the EC fats and oils tax proposal a dangerousprovocation," he said.
 "I feel that we shall probably have todeal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future."    Not only is the US Congress clearly very determined to getthe American balance of payments into better shape, but therisks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the EC hasits own constraints in meeting outside pressure, Engeringnoted.    "If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable thatwe keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war,then I think the answer is probably yes," he said.
    In order to reduce these tensions, decision-making in theEC must become less self-centred, and the US Administrationwill have to exercise the authority to convince Congress andpressure groups of the need for accommodation, he added. Reuter

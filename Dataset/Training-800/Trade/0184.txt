YEUTTER SAYS U.S.-JAPAN TRADE DIFFICULTIES REMAIN
U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the tradeissues straining U.S.-Japanese relations would be resolvedbefore the two countries open trade talks in late April.    "We are having high level discussions on them (the issues)within the United States..
.The relationship on some of those isvery strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need torelieve those strains at the earliest possible date," he said.    "I am not sure we can wait until late April," he added.
    Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting oftrade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of theGeneral Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT).    He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the nextfew days but declined to discuss methods of relieving thestrain between the two countries.    Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious tradeissues were semiconductors, Japanese government unwillingnessto allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and thebarring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansaiairport project near Osaka.
    The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in astatement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantletrade barriers in their country.    "I am convinced that they are attempting to move theirpolicies in the right direction. The question is how far andhow fast," Yeutter said.

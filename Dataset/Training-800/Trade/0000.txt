BRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY
inflationplan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of theeconomy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaringprices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed thevalue of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespreadindexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250pct inflation rate.    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.
    "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there wasinflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bankeconomist said.    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by adramatic reversal in the foreign trade account.
 In 1984 and1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient tocover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlrforeign debt.    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be ontarget for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging onebillion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and importsincreased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplusplunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averagedunder 150 mln.

AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SAYS AGRICULTURE GATT PRIORITY
Australian Trade MinisterJohn Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reformit will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis.    In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministersconference here he said agriculture is a problem which involvesall countries and seriously affects the debt servicingabilities of a number of developing countries.     He said major countries should be showing leadership onthis problem.
    "We will be giving close attention to the processes in theOECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) andelsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we willbe looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment toagricultural trade reform," Dawkins said.    The Venice summit is scheduled for June.    He said Australia's interests in the Uruguay Round, theeighth under the GATT, are wide ranging.
 Dawkins said he seesthe round as providing a timely opportunity to secure furthermeaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restoreconfidence in the multilateral system.    Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groupsestablished in Geneva after the GATT declaration last Septemberin Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, butit is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on theseprocesses.    "We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este onstandstill and rollback are carried into practice.
"    The standstill and rollback of protection offers the globaltrading system a chance to hold and wind back protection duringthe negotiations which are expected to last up to four years,he said. REUTER

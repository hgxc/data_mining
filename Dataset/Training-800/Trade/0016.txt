ROSTENKOWSKI RELUCTANT TO BACK TAX HIKE
House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to backthe tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.    He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be anumber of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan soughta tax increase to help balance the budget.    However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax ratesenacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.
    There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.    Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general taxincreases.    On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect themajor trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industryfor special protection.
    "To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,"he said.    This apparently ruled out congressional approval of anothertextile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as wasproposed again this year. Reuter

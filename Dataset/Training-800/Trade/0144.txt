JAPAN SAYS OECD STUDY ON SUBSIDIES STILL ONGOING
Japanese Agriculture Ministry officialssaid a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development, OECD, is still under wayand will be completed sometime next month.    The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far,and they said Japan would comment on the final results.    A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the studyhas found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies inthe world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any othercommodity producers from subsidies.
 The study has not beenofficially released due to objections from some countries.    Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept therelease of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said.OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meetingin mid-May.
    One agriculture ministry source said the study so far wasbased on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have droppedsharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy,and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said.    "The study is .
.. Unfair and unacceptable because it doesnot take account of various differences in farming conditionsin each country, such as geography," the source said.
    He said it is highly likely that the final study will showJapan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.    "This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farmmarket further, but this would have little impact on Japan'sagriculture policy," he said, without giving further details.    A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidiesby major exporting nations like the United States and theEuropean Community, but Japan is a major importer, he said.

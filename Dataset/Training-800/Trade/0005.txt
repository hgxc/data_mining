TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS
Taiwan plans another round of deep tariffcuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S.,A senior economic planner said.    Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economicplanning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would furtherreduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the secondhalf of this year.    Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year andWang said further cuts would go much deeper.
    "We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffsfaster and more substantially," he said.    The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has saidthe island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high ofalmost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts astoo selective.
     Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreignexchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said madeTaiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.
    Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakenedTaiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas,particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which areamong the island's main export-earners.    A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washingtontomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last yearlimiting exports of Taiwan textiles.    Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth waslimited to 0.
5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it islosing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were givenmore generous terms. REUTER..

AUSTRALIA ATTACKS U.S. GATT FARM RULES EXEMPTION
Australia accused the U.S. of increasingprotectionism on agricultural products and called for an end toWashington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT ruleson agricultural trade.    Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at aspecial annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.    "Australia today said the United States' goals of reducingU.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted byactions which in fact increased protection in trade inagriculture," the Australian delegation said in a statement.
    "The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basicflaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture," Arnott told themeeting.    Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as ajustification for "dubious protective measures" by the U.S. Helisted a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps toclose the U.S. sugar market to imports.    He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington toimpose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domesticsupport programs.
 This covered imports of dairy products,peanuts, cotton and sugar.    Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to theGATT, told Reuters: "These charges have been made since the verybeginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agriculturalpolicy, part of our law when we joined the GATT".
    "We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during theUruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same withtheir programs. We can negotiate them all," Samuels added.    Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguayround of talks launched in Punta del Este last September.
Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking,tourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well asmanufactured goods. Reuter

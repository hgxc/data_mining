PHILIPPINE TRADE SECRETARY PLEASED WITH GATT TALKS
Philippine Secretary ofTrade and Industry Jose Concepcion, who two days ago expresseddoubts about agreements produced at international conferences,said he was pleased with the latest gathering here.    Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informalGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gaveministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examineissues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.    "Also, the role of the developing countries has beenemphasised in this particular meeting.
 Somehow it has been theperception of developing countries that GATT is a club of richcountries," he added in an interview with Reuters.    "In fact many of the issues that have been tabled fordiscussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will beof more benefit to the developed countries," he said.    Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that theUruguay round was meant to be a "shining act of faith" in theworld trade system.
    Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues oftrade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machineryto make it more responsive.    He said tropical fruit came from developing countries butfaced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or veryhigh duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and SouthKorea as examples.
    He said he would go to Wellington for talks with NewZealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, toencourage it to switch imports from other countries. He notedthat New Zealand bought its bananas from Ecuador. REUTER

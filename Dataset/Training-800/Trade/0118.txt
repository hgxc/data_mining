UK TRADE WARY OF HIGHER EC GRAIN LEVY
The European Community may decide toincrease the cereals co-responsibility levy and extend itsscope to cover cereal substitutes if the Commission's 1987/88farm price package is opposed by member states, Edgar Pye,vice-president of the British agricultural merchants'association UKASTA, said.    At the moment the Commission is proposing the rate of levyremain unchanged at three pct - but Pye, addressing a feedmanufacturers' dinner in Glasgow, said this could change if itscontroversial plans to cut cereal prices and introduce an oilsand fats tax are blocked    Pye said UKASTA would continue to fight the cereals levy"tooth and nail."    However, a test case in the European Court of Justicecontesting the legality of the current regulation applying thelevy, which is being backed by the EC feed manufacturers'organisation FEFAC, was not now expected to be heard until theend of 1987, he said.

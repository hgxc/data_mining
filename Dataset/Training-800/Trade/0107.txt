BRITISH FARM MINISTER ATTACKS SUBSIDIES
Farm subsidies and protectionistmoves threaten healthy trade on both sides of the Atlantic,Michael Jopling, British minister of Agriculture, Fisheries andFood, warned.    "It would not be sensible to provoke another dispute betweenEurope and the United States," Jopling said in remarks preparedfor an evening speech.    "But some things are clear and they apply on both sides ofthe Atlantic.
 We cannot continue to pile up stocks while worlddemand shrinks," he said.    "Governments must not operate farm policies as if they werepurely domestic affairs with no impact on others. They alsohave to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop ahealthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionismand excessive subisdies.
    "And above all, Europe and the United States have too manycommon interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade warsand competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting noone." He added, "It is crucial that the United States and theEuropean Community remain friends."    Jopling, who is a member of the EC agriculture committee,was in Indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with U.S.officials in Washington later this week.
    Jopling also criticized a recent proposal still underconsideration by the EC for a tax on vegetable and fish oils.    He said his government would oppose such a move because "Wedo not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to support(EC) farmers should be alleviated by raising money at theconsumer's expense."

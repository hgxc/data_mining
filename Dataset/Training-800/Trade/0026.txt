YEUTTER PLANS TRADE TRIP TO CHINA THIS SUMMER
U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss tradeissues including China's admission to the General Agreements onTariffs and Trade.    Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible Chinacould be a member of GATT before the end of the year.    "They are making major moves to becoming a full scale memberof the world economy," he told the House Appropriationssubcommittee which oversees his agency's budget.
    Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms ofChina's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the finaltouches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip.    The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinationalgroup of nations which negotiates international rules on trade,would offer both potential export markets and potentialcompetition for U.S. industries, he said.    "That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S.business," Yeutter said.
    "I think China will develop into a fine market for us," headded. Reuter

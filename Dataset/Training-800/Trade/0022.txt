S. KOREAN TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. SEEN FALLING
South Korea's record 7.1 billion dlrstrade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as thecountry switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S.companies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said.     He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, anddenied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation.
    Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last yearSouth Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including arecord 7.
1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlrdeficit with Japan.    Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade missionis looking for 2.
0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S.companies, about a quarter of which represents "transferredpurchases from Japanese sources."    Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are"mainly chemicals, machinery and parts."    He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S.agricultural products.
 The current mission is not involved inthat area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts ofcotton" from the U.S.    He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the Americanmarket. Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be,"considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt andspends six pct of its gross national product on defense. Reuter

CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.
China called on the United States toremove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable tradingstatus and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 areinaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuadeCongress to change laws which limit its exports.    The official International Business newspaper todaypublished China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with thevisit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
    "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce itsrestrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilitiesfor them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chineseexports," the editorial said.    "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice againstfavourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit Chinainto the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).    "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports inrecent years, control of them is still extremely strict andinfluences normal trade between the two countries," it added.
    The paper also printed an article by China's commercialcounsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who saidthat "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventingbilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.    He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs ontechnology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. Reuter

NO CLEAR EVIDENCE TRADE GAP REVERSED - VOLCKER
Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said current data does not give a clear sign that thedeterioration in the U.S. trade balance has yet been reversed.    "The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidencethat the deterioration in the trade balance has yet beenreversed," Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to aluncheon for community leaders here.    However, Volcker said there are encouraging signs,particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year,achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad.
    Volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economicperspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make theinvestment needed to generate growth and earn the money toservice the debt.    He said the process of restoring external balance to theU.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit. He saidneeded economic adjustment will require a relative shift offinancial and real resources into internationally competitiveindustry.
 "More of our growth will need to be reflected in netexports and business investment and less in consumption,"Volcker said. Reuter

VOLCKER SAYS U.S. TRADE DEFICIT IS MAJOR CHALLENGE
Federal Reserve BoardChairman Paul Volcker said the U.S. Trade deficit is achallenge for the U.S. Equal to the Soviet Union launching ofSputnik.    "The international challenge implicit in our huge tradedeficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch ofSputnik by the Russians in the 1950s, when we suddenly fearedwe were to be left in the wake of Soviet technologicalachievement," he said in an address to Florida educators.     He said the trade problem underscored the need to reformthe U.S. Educational system to improve economic performance.
    The Commerce Department reported last week that thenation's trade gap, calculated on a balance-of-payments basis,swelled to a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter,bringing the 1986 deficit to a record 147.71 billion dlrs.
    Volcker called on educators to stress the development ofbasic reading, writing and mathematics skills and urged them tohelp students adapt to the fast-changing economic climate.    Volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education oflow-income minority groups such as blacks and Hispanics. REUTER

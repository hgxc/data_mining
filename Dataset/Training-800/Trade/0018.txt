U.S. SENATE PANEL COULD CONSIDER TRADE MEASURE
The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committeemay take up a bill tomorrow that would strengthen theactivities of U.S. agricultural trade teams in selecteddeveloping countries, committee staff said.    The measure, sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy(D-Vt.) and Sen.
 John Melcher (D-Mont.), would establish tradeteams of between six and nine persons drawn from federalagencies and private voluntary organizations, staff said.

    The trade teams would be made up of representatives of theU.S. Agriculture Department, State Department, the Agency forInternational Development and private voluntary organizationssuch as U.S. Wheat Associates.    The bill would require teams within six months to visitseven countries: Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, India,Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria.    Within one year after passage of the measure, another eightcountries would have to be visited: Peru, Kenya, the DominicanRepublic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco.

NAKASONE INTERVENES IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE WITH U.S.
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasoneintervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute withthe U.S. Over semiconductor trade, government officials said.    At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade andIndustry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calmU.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practicesin semiconductors.    Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduledmeeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Councilto consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pactwith the U.S.    That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations,calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world marketsand to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.
    Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to liveup to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action.    Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage thepact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting outJapan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output.    In his letter, the contents of which were released today,Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of Marchshowed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate pricesin Asian markets.
    In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITIvice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggestedthe two countries could conduct a joint investigation intoallegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets. REUTER

JAPAN OPENS HOME MARKET TO U.S. FISH
Japan has agreed to drop barriers toAmerican-caught herring and pollock, opening the way forshipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually, U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter announced.    Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensivebilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo.    He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments ofprocessed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mlndlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in lateryears.
    There was no immediate assessment of the value of currentU.S. shipments, but officials said the pact would lift quotasto the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly allthe pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms.    At the same time, Yeutter said Washington was temporarilysuspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of thetwo fish.    He said the complaint would be reviewed later this yearafter an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement.

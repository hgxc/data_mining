ROSTENKOWSKI OPPOSES PROTECTIONIST TRADE BILL
House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptationto pass a protectionist trade bill this year.    In remarks prepared for delivery before the National PressClub, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislationwill be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.
    But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the tradebill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warnother countries their access to the American market would becurtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.    "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not asmoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,"Rostenkowski said.    "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have deniedus access to open up in return for continued freedom in theAmerican market," he added.
    However, he said there would likely be changes in themarket access proposal from the plan which cleared the Houselast year. That plan would have set a specific time table forforeign countries to ease import restraints or they would facea 25 pct cut in exports to the United States. Reuter

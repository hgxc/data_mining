BRITAIN CALLS ON JAPAN TO INCREASE IMPORTS
Britain today called on Japan toincrease foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism andthe harm it would bring to it and other trading nations.    British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon saidJapan must heed a report issued by a Japanese governmentadvisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand tohelp cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy.    "I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems toJapan's domestic economy," he told a group of Japanesebusinessmen in London.
    "But these short term difficulties should not be allowed todeflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary," he said.    "It is not just a domestic issue for Japan. If importpropensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk fromprotectionist lobbies, particularly in the U.S. With whom Japanhas so massive a surplus," he said.
    "They may well succeed in securing action by governmentswhich would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japanand the U.K."    Channon said there had been substantial growth in thevolume of trade between Japan and Britain, amounting to 6.2billion sterling (9.8 billion dlrs) last year.
    But he added: "Regrettably too much of it was in onedirection, with the Japanese selling us 3.7 billion sterling(5.8 billion dlrs) more than we sold them.

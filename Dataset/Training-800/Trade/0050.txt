U.S. PAYMENTS GAP TO PERSIST, EX-FED CHIEF SAYS
The dollar will decline over the nexttwo to three years, but this is unlikely to result in acomplete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, saidAnthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and formerpresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.    In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon saidwithout elaboration that he expects a "significant decline inthe dollar," within the next three years.    "The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficitwill stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,"he said.
    Solomon described the structural core as about one-half ofthe current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited severalfactors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit.    For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any newinvestment in those manufacturing industries that shrank whenthe dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.
    In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increasedpropensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.    Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but saidit could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oilprices are stable and commodity values remain low.

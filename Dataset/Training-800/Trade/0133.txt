JAPAN TO ASK CHIP MAKERS TO SLASH OUTPUT FURTHER
The Ministry of International Trade andIndustry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to furtherslash output in the second quarter in an effort to save itssemiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said.    The United States has accused Japan of reneging on thesemiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-priceJapanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened totake retaliatory action after April 1.
    The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop sellingcut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports ofAmerican chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.    MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has beenpressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that willboost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.    Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers toreduce first quarter output by 10 pct.
 To meet that request,they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeksof the first quarter.    If that reduced production level were maintained through tothe end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pctbelow that of the first three months of the year.    MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said theministry has not yet decided on the extent of the secondquarter cutback.
    One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground inAsia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets thereare picking up.    MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanesesemiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attemptsto ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact. REUTER

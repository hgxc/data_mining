U.S. HOUSE PANEL APPROVES TRADE BILL
The U.S. House Ways and Means TradeSubcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version oflegislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge openforeign markets to more U.S. goods.    The measure now goes to the full House Ways and MeansCommittee next week, but major changes are not expected,congressional sources said.    "This product could very well be toughening our trade policyand doing it in a manner that opens markets without thisfrightening word 'protectionism'," Ways and Means chairman DanRostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.
    The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specificretaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign tradepractices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.    But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committeedebate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt tomandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. bycountries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exactform of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the Houseapproved his idea to force an annual 10 pct trade surplus cutby those countries. Reuter

AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS HELPING TO BOOST GDP
The strong contribution of exports tothe growth in Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in thefourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature ofthe data, private economists polled by Reuters said.    Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, afterrising 0.
2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a yearearlier.    Equally significant was the decline in both private andgovernment spending, they said.
    Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourthquarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureaufigures show. Consumer spending declined 0.
6 pct and governmentspending by 0.2.    Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking GroupLtd said the government's aim of reducing the current accountdeficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cutimports appeared to be working.
    However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keepgrowth restrained because if it accelerated too fast importswould increase and worsen the balance of payments.    Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added theresult was positive because growth was export-driven.    But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given thegrowth in exports disclosed in other statistics.
    The economists' comments were echoed by Treasurer PaulKeating in a statement issued in Canberra.    Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for areduction in the current account deficit, notably the declinein domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.    A further 3.

"It is clear that through the continued application of thatstrategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in itsexternal accounts and return to a more sustainable growthpattern," he added.

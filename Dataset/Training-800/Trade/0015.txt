U.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
Export Credits Guarantee Department hasnamed Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay'sBank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17years, to the post of executive director, a departmentspokesman said.    Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.    A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debtto the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recentyears.
    Stephens said the fall in business volume was a topconvern, adding that the department may have to compete moreaggressively with private insurance firms providing similarservices.    The department's annual report for the year ended March 31,1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7billion stg from 17.
4 billion the year before, while its debtto the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.    Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But amonghis chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesserdeveloped countries and their ability to pay for their imports.
    The agency will have to review its policies on insuringexport credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis,he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort ofthing we want to take a look at."    "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply ina peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,"Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD willstrike more countries from its list of political risk insurancerecipients.
    He noted that certain countries have already been removedfrom the list. REUTER

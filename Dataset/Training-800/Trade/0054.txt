SOVIET ECONOMIST SEES FEW GAINS IN U.S. TRADE
There is little chance Soviet exportsto the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscow's currenttrade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goodsin future, a Soviet economist said.    Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, anagent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told aU.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few itemsthat western nations want.    But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods andallowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encouragemodest export gains in future.
    Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth ofgoods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billiondlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.
    But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, totaltrade between the two countries would remain between two andthree billion dlrs a year.    "The post-detente embargoes have taught the USSR to limitits trading with the U.S.," he said. REUTER

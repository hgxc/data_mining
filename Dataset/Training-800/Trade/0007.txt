JAPAN MOVES TO TIGHTEN CHIP-EXPORT CURBS
The Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchipexports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve aU.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanesechipmakers doubt its usefulness.    A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers toissue certificates to specified trading houses stating they areauthorised exporters.    Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will berequired to show such a certificate, but those without it willnot automatically be denied licences, he said.
    But some industry officials predicted any governmentmeasures were likely to have limited effect as long as theworld semiconductor market remained weak.    U.S. Government and industry officials have complainedrepeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at belowcost to third countries despite the July agreement.    Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow ofcheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales bythird-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap betweenlow prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costsand set for Japanese makers under the agreement.
    The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey marketis increasing for one specific company, it suggests they aredistributing their products through their sales network knowingthey will be exported by some means. In that case we will askthem what they are doing to reduce the figure."    MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.
    But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. "As longas there is a gap between prices set under the pact and marketprices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap tomake money," a Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T> spokesman said. REUTER

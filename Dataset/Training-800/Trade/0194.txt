BRAZIL COMPUTER MARKET TO REMAIN CLOSED-MINISTER
Brazilian Science and TechnologyMinister Renato Archer said Brazil will keep its computermarket closed to foreign goods in order to give its own infantindustry time to develop.    "Every country establishes laws to protect its interests.The United States closed their borders at a certain stage tosome foreign goods and therefore protected its industrialdevelopment.
 Now it is time for Brazil to do likewise," Archersaid at the opening of a national software conference.    After several meetings, Brazil and the U.S. Have made nomajor progress in their computer row, which they have beentrying to resolve for the past 18 months.    The Reagan administration has objected to Brazil protectingits computer industry from imports.

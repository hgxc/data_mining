OECD AGREES EXPORT CREDIT REFORMS
The western industrialised nations haveagreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit forexports to developing countries, the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development said.    The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid tosubsidise export credits in so-called "mixed credits," the OECDsaid.    The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July thisyear and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixedcredits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct forcredits covering exports to the world's least developednations.
    Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculatingthe aid element in mixed credits, to take account of differentinterest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,which hosted the reform negotiations, said.    Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised tradeloans have also been revised with the aim of cutting thesubsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relativelyrich developing countries by July next year.    The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. Tostop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aidto subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.
    OECD officials said the agreement was based on aprovisional accord reached in January subject to ratificationby member governments. Some governments, including Austria, hadlinked their final approval to other trade credit issues whichwould be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.    By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixedcredits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies toocostly for frequent use.
    "A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade has been closed today," a senior U.S. Official herecommented. REUTER

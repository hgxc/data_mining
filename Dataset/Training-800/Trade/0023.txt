GATT COUNCIL DEFERS DECISION ON SEMICONDUCTORS
The ruling GATT Council deferred adecision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of aEuropean Community complaint against the U.S.- Japaneseagreement on exports of computer semiconductors.    David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main partieswould continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope ofresolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.
    The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protectthe U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,officially known as semiconductors.    The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules byallowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimumprices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.    The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gaveU.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.
    Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the ECcomplaint during the heated Council debate.    Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador MichaelSamuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges wereunfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks. Reuter

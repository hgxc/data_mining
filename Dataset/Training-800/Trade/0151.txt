LEADING ECONOMISTS CALL FOR MORE GROWTH ABROAD
A panel of four leading economiststold a congressional hearing today that foreign economies willneed to expand to avoid recession as the U.S. trade deficitdeclines.    C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury Departmentofficial, and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution toldthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the major exportingcountries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S.demand for imports is expected to fall.    "They need to beef up domestic demand as their tradesurplus falls," or unemployment will keep growing, Bergstensaid.
    Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit, which hit 169billion dlrs last year, will fall 30-40 billion dlrs a year forthe next two years as a result of the dollar's 35-40 pctdecline since September 1985.    The government should intervene to push the dollar downfurther if the previous declines do not lead to an improvementin the trade picture, if the U.S. budget deficit is not reducedand if foreign expansion does not occur, he added.    Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate forthe huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt.
 TheParis agreement between the major industrialized countriesprovided only for a pause in its decline, he said.    Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of Morgan GuarantyTrust Co., said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem oflagging growth in industrial economies, prolonged currencymisalignment, debt problems of the developing countries, andunbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries.
    John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, suggestedforeign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack fromthe U.S. trade deficit fall. Reuter

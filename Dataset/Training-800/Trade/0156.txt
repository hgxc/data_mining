GATT SUCCESS WILL TAKE PRESSURE, N.Z. MINISTER
Long term pressure by tradeministers is necessary if the current Uruguay round of talks onthe General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) is tosucceed, New Zealand's Overseas Trade minister Mike Moore said.    Moore told the opening meeting of trade ministers from 22nations gathered for informal talks on the GATT that ministers"need opportunities to keep in touch and to consider how thepolitical problems inherent in an exercise like this one can befaced and resolved."    Moore said the Taupo meeting is one of a series of suchinternational gatherings, which includes the OECD ministerialmeeting in May and the G-7 meeting in Venice in June, enablingministers to maintain contact.
    World trade conditions are getting better not worse, hesaid.    He said New Zealand is "moving rapidly and of our owninitiative in the direction of liberalisation, and I warn youwe shall be looking for partners." REUTER

Britain had a visible trade deficit of2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a reviseddeficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, officialstatistics show.
    Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the CentralStatistical Office (CSO) show the current account was indeficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised thirdquarter shortfall of 930 mln.    For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.
2. Billion shortfall anda 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.
    Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in thefourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give anestimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion.
 The fourth quarterfigure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.    The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to1.9 billion stg from 2.
25 billion.    In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.
    The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarterwas due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg anda reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSOsaid.    However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stglower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil tradeincreased by 2.
1 billion.    The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.    The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions,particularly for the most recent quarters are liable tosubstantial revisions as later information becomes available.

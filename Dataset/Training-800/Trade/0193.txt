UNIONIST URGES RETALIATION AGAINST JAPAN
William Bywater, president of theInternational Union of Electronic Workers, called on PresidentReagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices insemiconductor trade.    He said in a statement a crash program was needed in thesemiconductor industry to prevent the United States frombecoming "one of the world's industrial lightweights."    Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic PolicyCouncil prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide whatsanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement.
    The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to endselling semiconductors at below cost and to open its homemarket to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to foregoantidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.    But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stoppeddumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third countrydumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.
    Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way toforce prices up and end the dumping.    Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense ScienceBoard task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop newelectronic products and manufacturing processes and make theU.S. industory more competitive.    But he added the industry could not wait for legislation topass and that action was required now to help the depressedelectronic industry.
    Bywater said, "I urge the Reagan Administration to take fulland severe action immediately against Japan by invoking theretaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)." Reuter

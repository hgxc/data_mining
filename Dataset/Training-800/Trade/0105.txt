26 billion in January and, afterexcluding coffee and oil derivitives, was only slightly belowthe same month last year.    Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mlnin February 1986 because of lower prices, he added.    Fendt said that although the February results were lowerthan the average expected for the rest of the year, thegovernment's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987should be achieved.
 This would compare with a 1986 surplus of9.5 billion dlrs.    Exports this year are expected to total 22.
5 billion dlrsand imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled22.
4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.    Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.
27 billiondlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line withgovernment plans to foster economic growth.    Fendt said that imports were running at levels well abovethe traditional average for Brazil.
    In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oiland wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion inthe same 1986 period.
    This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilianindustry to equip to raise production and is perfectlycompatible with the government's program for economic growth,Fendt added. Reuter

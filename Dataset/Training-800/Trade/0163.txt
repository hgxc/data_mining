PHILIPPINES CRITICISES EC FOR VEGETABLE OIL LEVY
Philippines Trade andIndustry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministershe wondered if their agreement was of any real value after theEuropean Community (EC) imposed a levy on vegetable oils.    Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministersdeclared in Uruguay last September that the trade ofless-developed nations should not be disrupted.    He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lowertariffs on coconut oil but introduced a levy on vegetable oilsand fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries.
    Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the ECCouncil of Ministers, he noted that "I cannot help but wonderwhether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are ofany real value."    He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billionU.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this hadaffected the ability of developing nations to import goods andservices.    "The health and the growth of world trade requires that thenew development of developing countries losing their share ofworld trade be arrested and reversed," he said.

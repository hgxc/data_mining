GATT TO DEBATE U.S. CHARGES OF AIRBUS SUBSIDIES
The U.S. Will pursue its complaint thatEuropean governments unfairly subsidise the Airbus Industrieaircraft consortium in proceedings at the GATT civil aircraftcommittee, a GATT spokesman said today.    The U.S. Presented its case for the first time to theaircraft committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) during a special two-day session ending today.GATT rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce.
    The 20-member committee agreed to open debate on the U.S.Complaint, starting with informal consultations and thenholding a special session in July, trade officials said.    "The tension has eased," the permanent trade ambassador ofthe 12-member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters."The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels.
"    U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over whatthey call unfair government support for Airbus, voiced during avisit to European capitals in February.    In a letter calling for the special committee meeting,Washington charged France, West Germany, the U.K., Spain andthe EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus.    The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating ruleslaid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.
    Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement topurchase aircraft and support for development of airlinesduring the special session and asked the committee to confirmits view.    Official sources in the delegations said the U.S. Viewswould be considered during the informal consultations but theEuropeans would also be free to bring up any complaints againstAmerican civil aircraft practices.    Some delegates said the U.S. Position appeared to give suchbroad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civilaircraft accord needed re-negotiating.
 All these matters wouldbe considered during the informal meetings. Reuter

MARKET LOAN COULD BE PINNED TO U.S. TRADE BILL
Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., saidhe was considering amending the Senate Finance Committee'strade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan forsoybeans, corn and wheat.
    Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there wasgreat reluctance among members of the Senate AgricultureCommittee to reopen the 1985 farm bill, and that a marketingloan might have a better chance in the Finance panel.    The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which ineffect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at theworld price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in U.S. cottonexports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports.    Pryor serves on both the Senate Finance and AgricultureCommittees.

JAPAN DENIES BREAKING SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE PACT
Japan denied breaking a pact with theU.S. On semiconductor trade but said prices set out in the pactwere too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing theaccord.    "We are faithfully abiding by the ..
. Agreement but ofcourse there are some problems," a spokesman for theInternational Trade and Industry Ministry told Reuters.    He said the high semiconductor prices recommended by theagreement were leaving Japanese manufacturers piling up stocksof unsellable products.
 "We are aiming to reduce production inJapan but of course this takes time," he said.    The spokesman said some Japanese companies were sellingchips in Europe and Asia below stipulated prices, but added: "Itis only a matter of time before we solve this problem."    The eight month old pact aims to stop Japan selling largequantities of chips at knock-down prices to the United Statesand other countries and to increase U.S. Semiconductor sales inJapan.
    The U.S. Senate Finance Committee this week called onPresident Reagan in a non-binding resolution to retaliateagainst Japan for violating the agreement. REUTER

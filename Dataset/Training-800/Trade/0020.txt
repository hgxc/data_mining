BALDRIGE CONCERNED ABOUT KOREAN/TAIWAN DEFICITS
Secretary of Commerce MalcolmBaldrige expressed concern about the continuing U.S. tradedeficits with South Korea and Taiwan and said that without anadjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood ofimprovement.    Speaking to the President's Export Council, an industryadvisory group, Baldrige said the trade deficit issue was underdiscussion with those countries.    "I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment weprobably won't be able to see much of a change in the largesurplus that Taiwan in particular has with us," he said.
    In a wide-ranging discussion on U.S. trade matters,Baldrige also repeated U.S. concern about an attempted takeoverby Japan's Fujitsu company of Fairchild Computer.

Lastly, Baldrige said that the United States was hopefulthat it could complete a free market agreement with Canada bythe autumn, but said major issues, including acid rain,remained unresolved.

GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING
The Association of German CooperativeBanks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rateswould continue to remain low for the time being.    It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strongforeign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors inthe economy that could affect the long-term capital market.    The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion forhigher nominal interest rates.
 But a probable rise in inflationlate this year could give very slight grounds for a rise innominal rates at year's end and next year, it said.    The association said generally low interest rates,prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expectedstrong domestic demand led it to believe that the investmentclimate would remain friendly and the economy would continueits slow but very sure growth.    The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interestrates down on the short-term money market although its policieshad exerted little effect on the long-term capital market,which was so important for investment financing and thus forthe course of the economy, it said.
    In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policyhad in influencing the longer-term capital market, theassociation saw little sense in wanting to boost the economythrough a short-term and expansionist monetary policy.    On the other hand it also saw no reason for stickingdogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.    The association said time would show to what extentspeculative foreign money and short-term invested domesticmoney would distort money supply developments.
 The Bundesbankcould hold down money market rates with the highly effectiveinstrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said. Reuter

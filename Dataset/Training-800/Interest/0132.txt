FED'S POLICY EASE MAY END WITH 2ND QTR RATE CUT
The Federal Reserve's move to easiermonetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount ratecuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in thesecond quarter, analysts said.    A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates toedge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending ratefrom 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.    "The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further withouta full-blown recession," said Raymond Stone, chief financialeconomist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    Stone said economic data available by late June may be justweak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he saidit may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual halfpoint, to avoid hurting the dollar further.    All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open MarketCommittee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.
    The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughlyquarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasurybond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at whichbanks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the primelending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.    Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly tothe April-June quarter, follow:    - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct furtheragainst other major currencies because of a large U.S. budgetdeficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap.
 Contacted afterthe dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, theeconomists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is thatthe dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.    - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continuetrading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could welltest the lower end of that range.    - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter andprobably for all of 1987.
 Stocks should gain on strongforeign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. Theoutlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the yearsince both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.    - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflatorwill rise to around 3.
3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. Thesharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as willa mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.
    - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pctannual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand atrespective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 firstand second halves.
 First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pctannualrate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International seesboth the strongest economy and the highest interest rates amongthose surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pctrate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.
3 pct rate thisquarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.    "The economy will bounce back more strongly than manyexpect," Brusca said.
 He said an involuntary buildup ininventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quartereconomic growth, with consumer spending helping later.    "We're running out of special factors to keep the economyafloat," said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. Hisinterest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.
    Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulationhelped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that secondquarter growth could be zero or negative.
    Braverman said economic activity next quarter will sufferfrom a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow government spending and less construction. Only a marginallynarrower trade deficit will add to growth.    He sees a 7.
10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,respectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.
25 pct forbonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.
    Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildlyafter the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in pastdays and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.    David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Incraised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.
20pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.    Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, liftedhis forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a pointto eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds.
 Both Nicho andResler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.    The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japaneseinvestors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fearabout further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.trade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers.

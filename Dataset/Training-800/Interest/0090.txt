WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES
West German commercial banks arecautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, bankingsources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after theBundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than theusual interim period.    A Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cuttingleading savings rate for private customers on a regional basisby 0.
5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F>and Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bankfuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F> cut rates 0.
5 pct generally.    The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire togauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savingsbanks.    A fall in customer savings because of lower rates couldreduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them todraw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, oneeconomist at the German Banking Association said.
    But the volume of savings funds may not be substantiallyundercut by lower savings rates because many customers areparking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvestthem at higher yields in the future, he said.    He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move morefunds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-datedsecurities to reduce strong growth in its central bank moneysupply aggregate.    The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.
5pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside theexpanded target range of three to six pct.    Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to privatecustomers, though lending rates for corporate customers arebeginning to decline.

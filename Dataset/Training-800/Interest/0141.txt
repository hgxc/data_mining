INDIAN RATE CUTS TO SPARK INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE
The Indian Finance Ministry'sannouncement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation'sinterest rate structure, will benefit industry and agricultureby providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said.    The changes, effective today, included reducing commercialbank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pctby one percentage point.
    New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, alsoinclude a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, ondeposits of two years or more but less than five.    Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pctinterest have been abolished.    Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect thegovernment's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and helpimprove world competitiveness of Indian goods.
    There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank depositsby long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will createthe flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equityshares or short-term bank deposits, they said.    A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs dueto lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.
    Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange,opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closingof 1,012.50 rupees.    A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic nowto buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because theFinance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.
5pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively.    "But overall debenture prospects remain bright because therates of interest on them will still be higher than what bankspay for deposits of similar maturity," a merchant banker said.

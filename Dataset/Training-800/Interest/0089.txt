NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY FORECAST TO IMPROVE IN 1987/88
New Zealand's inflation and interestrates should decline and the balance of payments improvesignificantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988, theInstitute of Economic Research (NZIER) said.    The independent institute said in its quarterly March issuethat it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domesticproduct (GDP) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pctdrop forecast in December.
    Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct inthe quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter.
    The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June andSeptember quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure andthe introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services taxand is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87.    The government's tight fiscal position is not expected tochange, it said.    Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, isforecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.
2 pct incalendar 1986, it said.    "Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope forreductions in nominal interest rates; real interest rates arealso expected to ease (albeit slightly) as the balance ofpayments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital, fallsaway," the NZIER said.    Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20and 25 pct until the June quarter, but will decline over thesecond half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct.
 Long-termrates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct.    Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct andthe key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.
53 pct.    The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in theearly part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 onthe Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on abasket of currencies.
 The index now stands at around 66.4.    "A marked improvement in the balance of payments isforecast," the NZIER said.
 "The current account deficit isexpected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in1986/87 and 2.
5 pct in 1987/88."    The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32billion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.
40 billion in 1986/87 and3.33 billion in 1985/86.    The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.
8 billiondlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87billion in 1985/86.
    This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figureof 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion.
    "Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued tocontribute to marked improvements in both the balance ofpayments and the rate of inflation ...
," the NZIER said.    "Overall, these are significant gains for the New Zealandeconomy and, if they continue to be improved upon, bode wellfor future prospects." REUTER

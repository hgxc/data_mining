WORLD BANK TO BRING BORROWING FORWARD THIS YEAR
The World Bank intends to bringborrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because itexpects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bankvice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.    He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan,West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. "The weightof opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higherprobability there will be one pct higher than one pct lowerinterest rates," he said.
    The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so farthis year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.    The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at alevel that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where andhow much to borrow, Rotberg said.    Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years'anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstandingdebt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.
    Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, itdid not intend to launch new financial instruments just for thesake of innovation, Rotberg said.    Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only someeight billion had been swapped into another currency.
    Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors orunfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident thatthis was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.    The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed overthe next year with methods used before, Rotberg said.
 However,for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out newinstruments such as bonds with warrants.    The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germanysince the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.

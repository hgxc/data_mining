CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK LOWERING VISA RATES
<Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>said it was lowering the interest rate on its Visa credit cardto 15.9 pct from 18.6 pct, effective with the May billingstatement.
    The bank said it was also halving its yearly Visa card userfee to six dlrs, but would retain its 15 ct fee for eachtransaction.    A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by theCanadian Parliament's finance committee on March 20 for asubstantial cut in credit card rates "was a factor" in themove, but he would not elaborate.    Canada's minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin hadthreatened legislation to reduce the rates, which apply tounpaid balances, if the financial institutions did notvoluntarily act.
    The Canadian Imperial Bank spokesman said "the bank cardmarket is a very competitive one and we have to move to staycompetitive."    Canadian Imperial's new rates match those of <TorontoDominion Bank>, which lowered its rates before the financecommittee report.    Canadian Imperial Bank added that cardholders will beallowed to choose between the 15 ct transaction fee or the sixdlr yearly card fee.
    It will also eliminate the 50 ct minimum monthlytransaction fee, it said.    Minister of State for Finance, Tom Hockin, said in theHouse of Commons today he was "delighted" with the bank's cutin its credit card rate.    "I would hope retail stores and other financialinstitutions will look to their rates as well," Hockin saidduring the daily question period.

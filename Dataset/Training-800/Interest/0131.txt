GROS DENIES COURT ACTION AGAINST BRAZIL
Central Bank president Francisco Grosdenied rumours that foreign creditors had filed court actionsagainst Brazil to seek payment of its 109-billion dlr debt.    "There is no court action against Brazil," Gros said in atelevision interview.    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68billion dlr debt to commercial banks and yesterday suggested anextension of short-term credit lines for 60 days until May 31.
    Media reports said some banks rated as small among Brazil's700 creditors had filed lawsuits against the decision tosuspend interest payments.    Gros said negotiations with the commercial creditors wouldstart within two weeks, when he and Finance Minister DilsonFunaro attend council meetings of the International MonetaryFund (IMF) in Washington.    "Brazil is facing the issue very carefully.
 We are seeking anegotiation that will give the country space to grow, becauseonly with growth will we be able to meet our commitments," Grossaid. REUTER

PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS DELAYED FOR CONSULTATIONS
Today's debt rescheduling talksbetween the Philippines government and its bank advisorycommittee were postponed until Thursday to give the banks moretime to consider Manila's novel proposal for paying part of itsinterest bill in notes instead of cash, bankers said.    The committee banks met briefly earlier today and decidedthat they needed more time in particular to consider a newsreport which quoted a Reagan Administration official as urgingthat the proposal be given serious consideration.    "The banks felt that this was new information and thatfurther consultation was called for," one banker said.
        In a despatch yesterday from Washington, Reuters quoted theofficial as saying Manila's plan to pay some interest withnotes that could be converted into equity investments in thePhilippines was fully consistent with the Reagan Administrationstrategy for handling developing country debt.    "The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quiteunique and I don't think it's something that should becategorically rejected out of hand," the official said.    Because of the key role the U.S. plays in the debt crisis,foreign banks in particular wanted time to analyze thesignificance of the policymaker's comments, bankers said.

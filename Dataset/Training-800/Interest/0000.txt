JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES
Japan is expected to cut the base lendingrate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 aspart of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,Finance Ministry sources said.
    They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust FundBureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits withthe bureau.    The bureau channels funds to government financialinstitutions for public works and other official uses, theysaid.
    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the JapanDevelopment Bank, People's Finance Corp and the financecorporations of local public enterprises usually moves intandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,to 5.8 pct from 6.
2 pct on January 28, because the Trust FundBureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce amarket-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate thedomestic economy, they said.
    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cuttheir prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositorsusing the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts andTelecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity ofthe Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
    These ministries are trying to determine which market ratesshould be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,the ministry sources said.    Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.

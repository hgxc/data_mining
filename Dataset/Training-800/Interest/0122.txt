BANK OF SPAIN PROVIDES YEAR RECORD ASSISTANCE FUNDS
The Bank of Spain provided 1,145 billionpesetas in assistance funds which bankers said reflected fearsof fresh increases in overnight rates.    The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comesafter the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billionpesetas.    A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higherovernight call money rates were expected in the short term inview of disappointing money supply figures for February.
    The M-4 money supply, measured as liquid assets in publichands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January andcompared with this year's eight pct target.
 Money supply growthwas 11.4 pct last year.    The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by aquarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746billion pesetas.
 Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of theyear and have been increased to drain liquidity on risingdemand for funds. "The policy is proving counter-productive andrates will have to come down in the long-term," the bankspokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries.
    He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short-termspeculative capital from abroad.    "At least 800 mln dlrs of current excess liquidity in thesystem is convertible pesetas from West Germany and othercountries with much lower rates," he said. REUTER

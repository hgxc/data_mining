MAJOR U.S. BANKS MOVE TO HIGHER 7-3/4 PCT PRIME
Most major U.S. banks today matchedTuesday's quarter-point prime rate cuts by Citibank and ChaseManhattan Bank, the first prime rate boosts since mid-1984.    Most cited narrower spreads between the prime and fundingcosts as justification. Analysts said the prime rate rises mayhave been triggered partly by a desire by banks to enhanceprofit margins given problems with developing country loans.
     Commenting on the prime rate increases, U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker told a House Appropriations Committeethat "I hope it was a temporary blip upward."    Among the major banks which today announced prime rateincreases to 7-3/4 pct were Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank,Continental Illinois National Bank, Harris Trust and SavingsBank, Irving Trust, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, MarineMidland, and Security Pacific National Bank.    Other banking companies announcing prime rate risesincluded Pittsburgh National Bank, Texas Commerce Bank-Houston,Provident National Bank, First National Bank of Boston, FloridaFederal Savings and Loan Association, and SunTrust Banks.

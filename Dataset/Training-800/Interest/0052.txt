SUMITA SAYS LITTLE ROOM FOR BANK TO EASE POLICY
Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumitasaid there is little room left for the central bank to furtherease its credit policy as interest rates levels are nowapproaching their lower limit.    "The government should instead seek ways of making the bestuse of its fiscal policy," he told a press conference.    His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economicstimulative package the government plans to adopt in the comingdays.
    At the recent talks among the six major industrialisednations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensiveeconomic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn wouldhelp increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus.    Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn inthe second half of the year if the yen remains stable.    He said there is caution in the foreign exchange marketagainst a further rise of the yen and mark and this explainsthe recent stability in the currency markets.

AUSTRIAN BANKS DIVIDED OVER INTEREST RATE CUT
Calls for a cut in Austrian interestrates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are dividedover the issue.    Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse undKommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half apercentage point in interest rates across the board. But HannesAndrosch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> toldReuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.
    Vak told a news conference that last January's cut inlending rates for commercial customers and for all depositorsby a quarter point had been insufficient.    The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering ofits discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with asimilar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.
75 pct anddeposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.
    Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the GenossenschaftlicheZentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of apoint, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.    Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. Awidening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West Germancredit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growththis year also justified a further interest drop, he said.
    Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank deroesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called forlower deposit rates but said lending rates should remainunchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small,particularly when compared with other West European countries.    But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste OesterreichischeSpar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unlessWest German rates came down first.
    Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower ratesalone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcomingopposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank. REUTER

H.K. BANKS TO RAISE PRIME RATES SOON, DEALERS SAY
Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raiseprime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following aone-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banksyesterday, dealers said.    They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase atthis weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association ofBanks.    G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, saidprime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.
    Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2pct, the level at beginning of 1987.    The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from fivepct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 onJanuary 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kongdollar, he said.    The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today,with three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct againstyesterday's five to 4-13/16 close.
 The overnight rate, however,fell to 3-1/2 to three pct from 4-1/2 to four because ofincreased liquidity for a local stock issue. REUTER

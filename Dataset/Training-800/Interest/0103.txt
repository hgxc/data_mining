GATT MEETING HEARS PLEA FOR AFRICAN DEBT RELIEF
Debt among African countrieswill continue to grow and their economies remain stifled unlessdeveloped countries lower their interest rates, Nigerian TradeMinister Samaila Mamman said.    He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) meeting the widening gap between developed anddeveloping countries and an inequitable international economicsystem were major impediments to growth in developingcountries.    Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks inthe New Zealand resort of Taupo.
    "I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of theexternal indebtedness of African countries reflects the fulleffect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of thedeveloped market economy countries," Mamman said.    "The developed market economy countries have slowed downoutput growth thereby drying up markets for the commodityexports of African countries."    Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.
3 billion dlrs ayear would be needed over the next five years for the Africancontinent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth(GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990.    Yet at the same time Africa's debt service was estimated at24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990.
    "With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three tofour pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debtpersists," Mamman said. Developed countries must seekalternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer ofresources and more indebtedness, he said.    "The international community cannot fail to respondpositively to the collapse of the international market forcommodities .
.. And act quickly to stabilize demand and pricesof our commodity exports," he added.

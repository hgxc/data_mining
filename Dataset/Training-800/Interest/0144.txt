U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - PRIME RATE
The prospect that other banks willfollow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raisingtheir prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the creditmarkets today, economists said.    Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two daysof heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market byannouncing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.
    Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar- the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on thenews.    Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in theEuromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.    Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fearsof a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, buteconomists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whosepolicy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets thisweek, is already tightening its grip on credit.
    "The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting thebanking system's reserve needs this statement period, but Iwouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data," saidJeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank. REUTER^M

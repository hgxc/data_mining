BRAZIL'S GROS TO MEET BANKS ON TRADE LINE ISSUE
Brazil's central bank governorFrancisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here todayin a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country'sunilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrsof foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said.    Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head ofBrazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads MorganGuaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc.    High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil'saccompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term tradeand interbank lines, the bankers said.
    Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreedlast March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, aspart of a 31 billion dlr financing package.    Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupledwith Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legalquestions that the banks want to discuss with Gros.    They said they face problems because of the freezerequirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bankunder the trade facility must be deposited instead with thecentral bank.
 This means foreign bankers cannot easily switchtheir credit lines from one borrower to another.    The requirement to deposit with the central bank has alsomeant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lowerinterest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would ratheraccept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with thecentral bank.    "It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,"one banker said.
    Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results ofa 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance ministerDilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support forBrazil's debt stance. REUTER

NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY
The Bundesbank is unlikely to changeits credit policies at its central bank council meeting onThursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates havestabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.    Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow'stender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds willbe credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining16 billion marks from the system.    The tender was announced last Friday, because carnivalfestivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and willclose banks here this afternoon.
    Because of the disruption to business from carnival,minimum reserve figures for the start of the month areunrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess theirneeds at the tender.    Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enoughliquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.    But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marksthis week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
    "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amounta little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.    "They would then stock it up at the next tender when theneed is clearer," he added.    An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.
5 billionmarks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporarydrain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.    Banks held 52.
0 billion marks on February 27 at theBundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, justclear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

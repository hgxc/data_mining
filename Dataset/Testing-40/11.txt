NBC NEWS SAYS U.S. HAS RETALIATED AGAINST IRAN
U.S. television networks said onMonday that U.S. forces launched a retaliatory strike againstIran late Sunday, apparently attacking two Iranian offshore oildrilling platforms.    NBC News said it understood six Iranians had been pulledfrom the sea.    It said cautiously that U.S. forces attacked late Sundayand that two Iranian oil platforms east of Bahrain were ablazeas a result, but CBS News and other networks said flatly thatU.S. forces attacked the Iranian oil platforms.
    U.S. officials had been meeting on a response since Fridaywhen an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged aU.S.-flagged ship.    President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made adecision on the U.S. response to Friday's Iran attack but wouldnot say what the decision was.    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday theattack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday wasalmost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile.

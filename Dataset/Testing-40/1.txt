TASS DENOUNCES U.S. ATTACK ON IRAN AS ADVENTURISM
The official Soviet news agency Tassdenounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform inthe Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it wouldbring no dividends to the Reagan administration.    Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administrationhad embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflectattention from the scandal in which the United States sold armsto Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.    "The confrontation is a fact now.
 What is obvious is thatthe latest military adventure will not bring politicaldividends to the American administration," Krutikhin said.    Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier onMonday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they wereconcerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.    Soviet officials have previously criticized the UnitedStates for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying theirpresence serves to increase tension.
    Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran andIraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also soughtbroader contacts with Iran in the last year.    Krutikhin said: "The United States has undertaken an act ofarmed aggression against Iran, the probability of which haslong been spoken of by Washington officials.

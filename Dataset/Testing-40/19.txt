IRAN, SOVIET UNION TO SWAP CRUDE, REFINED PRODUCTS
The Soviet Union has agreed to supplyIran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrelsper day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said.    IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister GholamrezaAqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that theagreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signedduring his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the SovietUnion might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibilitystudies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields insouthern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.    Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part ofits oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.    Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the SovietUnion, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before heleft for Moscow.
    Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulfwar and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refinedproducts.    Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered atthe Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near theCaspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran. REUTER

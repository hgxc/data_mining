JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE
Bank of Japan sources said the bankhas no plans to cut its discount rate.    They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japanduring the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lowerits discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feelany need for a cut at all.
    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reportersearlier today that some countries - those with strongcurrencies - might have to cut interest rates.    The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon tocall the G-7 pact a failure.    The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar'srenewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked byremarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that thedollar's fall had been orderly.
    They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker'scomments because he was referring to the dollar's fall sincethe Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,not the currency's recent movements.    They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seizeon anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way orthe other.    The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting moreweight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging marketstability than on other currencies.
    Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangersthat would arise from a further dollar fall because it wouldreduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting theU.S. And world economies, they said.    In February and in March of this year, Japanese investorsreduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sourcessaid.    Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view aboutcurrency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.
    This is because the overall foreign exchange market is atriangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen anddollar/European currencies.    At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries didnot want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they didnot object to the yen strengthening, they said. REUTER

SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID
Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countriesfor emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by thecountry's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.    Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aidneeded for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.
    The letter said the government had to step in "to avertserious economic hardship" and because the Social ServicesMinistry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provisionof 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.    The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a sixmonth period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice cropwas harvested.
 Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour andother cereals were required, it said, along with supplies ofsugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.    In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha(October 1986-April 1987) crop had been "almost completelydevastated," the letter said. Maha paddy output was nowestimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originallyexpected.
    There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a highforecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequaterainfall within the next three to four weeks.    "Should the present drought continue, however, production isestimated at around 20 mln bushels," the letter added.    Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90and 110 mln bushels, or 1.
35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Lastyear's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.
    The letter said villagers in most seriously affecteddistricts had been deprived of any means of subsistence becausesubsidiary crops had also failed.    It said the government's current budget did not permit itto provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected."Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodityprices and slowing of the economy.
 Defence commitments continueto exert pressure on the expenditure side."    The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees permonth for each family, as well as handling, transport anddistribution of emergency food.
 But such an outlay of funds bythe government would not be possible without seriouslyimpairing development projects, or "greatly fuelling inflation"in the economy, the letter said.    The letter said the Food Department would be able torelease wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet theimmediate cereal requirements "provided such stocks are replacedsubsequently."    The Meteorological Department said the country wasexperiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-monthdry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break whenthe monsoon rains fell in late May.
    The letter said some areas had been experiencing thedrought since August, and in the rice growing district ofKurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June1986. Reuter

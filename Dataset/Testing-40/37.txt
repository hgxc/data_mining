JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS
Basic reform of Japan's protected farmsector is a key to shifting its economy away from export todomestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its tradesurplus, securities analysts said.    The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs andquotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, andsheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, theysaid.    "In economic terms, reform would be a plus," said ChristopherChew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.
    The ultimate cost of the existing system is food pricestwice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,The analysts said.    Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of theaverage household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the grossnational product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.    Reducing these prices could increase household spendingpower by five pct, his study said.
 The money could be spent onproducts which would have a more direct impact in boostingdomestic growth, it added.    "There's a lot of slack," a U.S. Government official in Tokyosaid. "All that money could be spent on something else.
"    Direct central government subsidies to the farm sectoramount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independentestimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.    Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farmon weekends to put their land up for sale for residentialdevelopment would also give a boost to domestic spending,economists said.
    "Housing construction is the key strategic variable in theexpansion of domestic demand," wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professorat Kyoto Gakuen University.    Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reformto shift some of the burden of trade friction and economicrestructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto thefarm sector. Employers groups also want change.
 "If you reallywant to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not toraise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices," BumpeiOtsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'Associations told a recent press conference.    External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seekremoval of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their tradedeficits with Japan.    But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain wellentrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.
    Although the full-time farm population is falling and thereare signs the LDP is paying more attention to urbanconstituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent onfarm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth severalcity votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.    The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reformplan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,the analysts said.
    Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept thetraditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay fornational food security, they said.    Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed toimport liberalisation, but are more flexible about reformsaimed at stepping up productivity, they said.    Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specificpressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.

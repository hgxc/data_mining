TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS
Taiwan announced plans for another roundof import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before tradetalks with Washington which officials described as a move tohelp balance trade with the United States.    Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry'sCustoms Administration Department, told reporters the list ofproducts included 60 items asked by Washington.    "The move is part of our government efforts to encourageimports from our trading partners, particularly from the UnitedStates," he said.
    He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinetthat the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cutby between five and 50 pct.    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursdayand the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly startingon April 20, he added.    Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce itsgrowing trade surplus with the United States, the island'slargest trading partner.
    Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts andpressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge tradedeficit with Taipei.    Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.
2 billion in 1985. Itwidened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.
78billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.    Today's announcement came before a departure later today ofa 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series oftrade talks with U.S. Officials.    The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters lastnight he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he wouldface tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionistsentiments in the U.S. Congress.
 Taiwan's 1986 trade surpluswith Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.    Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.    "I am afraid this time we have to give more than take fromour talks with the U.S.," he said without elaborating.
